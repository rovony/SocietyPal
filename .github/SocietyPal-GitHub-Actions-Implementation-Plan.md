## 🎯 CodeCanyon Deployment Strategy

### Two-Stage CodeCanyon Installation Pipeline

**NEW: Enhanced deployment strategy for CodeCanyon applications with frontend installers**

#### Stage 1: Pre-Installation Deployment (`codecanyon-first-install.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Deploy code while preserving installer directories
- **Permissions**: Temporary 777 permissions for installation process
- **Security**: Minimal exposure with immediate Stage 2 requirement
- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch or push to branches with installer changes

```yaml
Workflow Features:
  - CodeCanyon application detection
  - Preserves /install and /installer directories
  - Sets temporary 777 permissions for installation
  - Deploys with atomic symlink switching
  - Creates stage completion tracking
  - Provides clear next-step instructions
```

#### Stage 2: Complete Installation (`codecanyon-complete-install.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Secure installer and apply final permissions
- **Security**: Reverts to environment-appropriate permissions
- **Verification**: Checks installation completion before securing
- **Cleanup**: Removes/disables installer directories

```yaml
Security Features:
  - Intelligent installation verification
  - Environment-specific permission lockdown
  - Installer directory security (remove/disable)
  - Laravel cache optimization
  - Comprehensive security audit
  - Emergency lockdown capabilities
```

#### Permission Strategy (Based on Laravel Permissions Guide)
```yaml
Pre-Installation (Stage 1):
  - storage/: 777 (temporary)
  - bootstrap/cache/: 777 (temporary)
  - config/: 777 (temporary)
  - public/: 777 (temporary)
  - .env: 600 (always secure)

Post-Installation (Stage 2):
  - Local: 775 for writable directories
  - Production: 755 for writable directories
  - Config: 755 directories, 644 files
  - .env: 600 (always secure)
```

### Regular Laravel Applications
- **Workflow**: Uses existing `deploy.yml` with CodeCanyon detection
- **Integration**: Automatically detects and skips CodeCanyon-specific steps
- **Backwards Compatible**: No impact on existing deployments

   - 🔒 **First Installation - Part 2** (`first-install-part2.yml`)

---

### 🔐 Phase B: GitHub Secrets and Environment Configuration

#### Step B.1: Create GitHub Environments (RECOMMENDED)

**IMPORTANT**: GitHub Environments provide better security and organization for secrets per deployment target.

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (top menu)
3. **In left sidebar, navigate to "Environments"**
4. **Click "New environment"** 
5. **Create staging environment:**
   - Name: `staging`
   - Click "Configure environment"
6. **Create production environment:**
   - Name: `production`  
   - Click "Configure environment"
   - **Optional**: Add protection rules (require approvals, restrict branches)

#### Step B.2: Navigate to Secrets and Variables

1. **In left sidebar, navigate to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"**
2. **You'll see tabs for "Secrets" and "Variables"**
3. **Each tab shows both "Environment secrets/variables" and "Repository secrets/variables"**

#### Step B.3: Choose Your Configuration Strategy

**Strategy A: Environment-Specific Secrets (RECOMMENDED)**
- ✅ **Better security**: Secrets are isolated per environment
- ✅ **Better organization**: Clear separation of staging/production
- ✅ **Protection rules**: Can require approvals for production
- ✅ **Branch restrictions**: Can limit which branches deploy where

**Strategy B: Repository-Level Secrets**
- ⚠️ **Less secure**: All secrets available to all workflows
- ⚠️ **Less organized**: Must differentiate secrets by naming
- ✅ **Simpler setup**: One place for all secrets

**We'll document both methods, but recommend Strategy A for production-grade security.**

#### Step B.4A: Configure Environment-Specific Secrets (RECOMMENDED)

**For STAGING Environment:**

1. **Go to "Environments" → Click "staging"**
2. **Scroll to "Environment secrets"**
3. **Click "Add environment secret" for each:**

| Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `SERVER_HOST` | `31.97.195.108` | Hostinger server IP |
| `SERVER_USER` | `u227177893` | SSH username |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `65002` | SSH port |

| `DB_PASSWORD` | `V0Z^G=I2:=r^f2` | Staging DB password |
| `LICENSE_CONTENT` | `[Your License]` | CodeCanyon license (if applicable) |

**For PRODUCTION Environment:**

1. **Go to "Environments" → Click "production"**
2. **Scroll to "Environment secrets"**
3. **Click "Add environment secret" for each:**

| Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `SERVER_HOST` | `31.97.195.108` | Hostinger server IP |
| `SERVER_USER` | `u227177893` | SSH username |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `65002` | SSH port |
| `SERVER_SSH_KEY` | `[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]` | Private SSH key (see B.5) |

#### Step B.4B: Alternative Repository-Level Secrets (SIMPLER)

**If you prefer simpler setup, use repository-level secrets:**

1. **Go to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"**
2. **Click "Repository secrets" → "New repository secret"**
3. **Add these secrets:**

| Order | Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `SERVER_HOST` | `31.97.195.108` | Hostinger server IP |
| 2 | `SERVER_USER` | `u227177893` | SSH username |
| 3 | `SERVER_PORT` | `65002` | SSH port |

| 14 | `DB_PASSWORD_STAGING` | `V0Z^G=I2:=r^f2` | Staging DB password |
| 15 | `PRODUCTION_LICENSE_CONTENT` | `[Your License]` | Production license (CodeCanyon) |
| 16 | `STAGING_LICENSE_CONTENT` | `[Your License]` | Staging license (CodeCanyon) |

#### Step B.5: SSH Key Setup (Critical Step)

**Option 1: If you already have an SSH key for the server:**
```bash
# Copy your existing private key
cat ~/.ssh/your_existing_key
```

**Option 2: Generate a new SSH key pair:**
```bash
# Generate new SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-societypal" -f ~/.ssh/societypal_deploy

# Copy the private key for GitHub secrets
cat ~/.ssh/societypal_deploy

# Copy the public key to add to server
cat ~/.ssh/societypal_deploy.pub
```

**Add Public Key to Server:**
```bash
# Connect to server
ssh -p 65002 u227177893@31.97.195.108

# Add public key to authorized_keys
echo "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_CONTENT_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

**Add Private Key to GitHub Secrets:**
- Copy the COMPLETE private key (including headers)
- Format should be:
  ```
  -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  [key content here]
  -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```
- Add as `SERVER_SSH_KEY` secret in GitHub

#### Step B.6: Configure Repository Variables (Non-Sensitive Data)

**Use Variables for non-sensitive configuration that might change:**

1. **Click the "Variables" tab**
2. **Choose "Repository variables" or "Environment variables"**
3. **Add these variables:**

| Variable Name | Value | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| `DEPLOYMENT_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Deployment timeout in seconds |
| `HEALTH_CHECK_RETRIES` | `3` | Number of health check retries |
| `KEEP_RELEASES` | `3` | Number of releases to keep |
| `LARAVEL_ENV` | `production` / `staging` | Laravel environment |

#### Step B.7: Deploy Keys (Alternative to SSH Key in Secrets)

**GitHub recommends Deploy Keys for repository access. This is an alternative to storing SSH keys in secrets:**

1. **Go to "Settings" → "Security" → "Deploy keys"**
2. **Click "Add deploy key"**
3. **Benefits:**
   - ✅ Repository-specific access only
   - ✅ Better security than broad SSH access
   - ✅ Can be read-only or read-write
   - ⚠️ More complex setup for server access

**For this implementation, we use SSH keys in secrets for simplicity, but Deploy Keys are recommended for enterprise setups.**

#### Step B.8: Legacy Database Configuration (DEPRECATED)</search>
</search_and_replace>

**Add these secrets in order:**

| Order | Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 5 | `DB_HOST_PROD` | `127.0.0.1` | Production DB host |
| 6 | `DB_PORT_PROD` | `3306` | Production DB port |
| 7 | `DB_DATABASE_PROD` | `u227177893_p_zaj_socpal_d` | Production DB name |
| 8 | `DB_USERNAME_PROD` | `u227177893_p_zaj_socpal_u` | Production DB username |
| 9 | `DB_PASSWORD_PROD` | `t5TmP9$[iG7hu2eYRWUIWH@IRF2` | Production DB password |

#### Step B.5: Configure Staging Database Secrets

**Add these secrets in order:**

| Order | Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 10 | `DB_HOST_STAGING` | `127.0.0.1` | Staging DB host |
| 11 | `DB_PORT_STAGING` | `3306` | Staging DB port |
| 12 | `DB_DATABASE_STAGING` | `u227177893_s_zaj_socpal_d` | Staging DB name |
| 13 | `DB_USERNAME_STAGING` | `u227177893_s_zaj_socpal_u` | Staging DB username |
| 14 | `DB_PASSWORD_STAGING` | `V0Z^G=I2:=r^f2` | Staging DB password |

#### Step B.6: Configure CodeCanyon License Secrets (If Applicable)

**If your app is a CodeCanyon application, add these secrets:**

| Order | Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 15 | `PRODUCTION_LICENSE_CONTENT` | `[Your CodeCanyon License]` | Production license content |
| 16 | `STAGING_LICENSE_CONTENT` | `[Your CodeCanyon License]` | Staging license content |

### ✅ Phase C: Verification and Testing

#### Step C.1: Verify All Secrets Are Configured

1. **Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. **Confirm you see all required secrets:**
   - `SERVER_HOST`
   - `SERVER_USER`
   - `SERVER_PORT`
   - `SERVER_SSH_KEY`
   - `DB_HOST_PROD`
   - `DB_PORT_PROD`
   - `DB_DATABASE_PROD`
   - `DB_USERNAME_PROD`
   - `DB_PASSWORD_PROD`
   - `DB_HOST_STAGING`
   - `DB_PORT_STAGING`
   - `DB_DATABASE_STAGING`
   - `DB_USERNAME_STAGING`
   - `DB_PASSWORD_STAGING`
   - `PRODUCTION_LICENSE_CONTENT` (if CodeCanyon app)
   - `STAGING_LICENSE_CONTENT` (if CodeCanyon app)

3. **Total count should be:**
   - **14 secrets** for regular Laravel apps
   - **16 secrets** for CodeCanyon apps

#### Step C.2: Test SSH Connection

```bash
# Test SSH connection with your key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/societypal_deploy -p 65002 u227177893@31.97.195.108

# If successful, you should see the server prompt
# Type 'exit' to disconnect
```

#### Step C.3: Test Database Connections

**Test Production Database:**
```bash
ssh -p 65002 u227177893@31.97.195.108
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u u227177893_p_zaj_socpal_u -p u227177893_p_zaj_socpal_d
# Enter password: t5TmP9$[iG7hu2eYRWUIWH@IRF2
# Should connect successfully
```

**Test Staging Database:**
```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u u227177893_s_zaj_socpal_u -p u227177893_s_zaj_socpal_d
# Enter password: V0Z^G=I2:=r^f2
# Should connect successfully
```

#### Step C.4: Prepare Server Directory Structure

```bash
# Create required directories on server
ssh -p 65002 u227177893@31.97.195.108 "
    mkdir -p /home/u227177893/domains/societypal.com/releases
    mkdir -p /home/u227177893/domains/societypal.com/deploy/shared
    mkdir -p /home/u227177893/domains/staging.societypal.com/releases
    mkdir -p /home/u227177893/domains/staging.societypal.com/deploy/shared
    
    # Set proper permissions
    chmod 755 /home/u227177893/domains/societypal.com
    chmod 755 /home/u227177893/domains/staging.societypal.com
"
```

#### Step C.5: Final Setup Verification

**Run the validation script locally:**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/malekokour/Zaj_Master/MyApps/MyLaravel_Apps/2_Apps/SocietyPal-Project/SocietyPalApp-Master/SocietyPalApp-Root

# Make the validation script executable
chmod +x .github/scripts/validate-setup.sh

# Run validation (this checks your local setup)
./.github/scripts/validate-setup.sh
```

**Expected output:** ✅ All checks should pass with "VALIDATION COMPLETE - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT"
