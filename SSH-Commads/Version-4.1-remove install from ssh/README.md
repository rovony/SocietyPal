- **File:** `deployment-prep-report.md`
- **Built By:** Phase-A-Prep + Phase-B-Prep
- **Purpose:** Early validation and preparation guidance
- **Content:** Server readiness, application compatibility, manual action items

### **Comprehensive Deployment Report** (Post-Deployment Analysis)
- **File:** `deployment-report-TIMESTAMP.md`
- **Built By:** Phase C-2
- **Purpose:** Complete deployment verification
- **Content:** Infrastructure status, security verification, performance analysis

### **Health Issues Report** (Auto-Fix Analysis)
- **File:** `health-issues-TIMESTAMP.html`
- **Built By:** Phase C-3
- **Purpose:** Runtime health with interactive fixes
- **Content:** Categorized issues, auto-fixes applied, action items

## 🎛️ **KEY FEATURES**

### **🔍 Smart Detection (Prep Scripts)**
- **Early Warning System:** Detect issues before they cause deployment failures
- **Smart Composer Logic:** Server-wide first, per-domain fallback
- **Hosting Panel Instructions:** Exact steps for PHP extension enablement
- **100% Non-Destructive:** Only detection and reporting, no automatic changes

### **🔧 Proven Deployment (Existing Scripts)**
- **Battle-Tested:** Existing working scripts maintained exactly as-is
- **Zero Downtime:** Symlink-based deployments with shared resources
- **Comprehensive Preparation:** Backups, maintenance mode, security setup

### **🏥 Intelligent Auto-Fixing (Health Scripts)**
- **Redis Fallbacks:** Automatic Redis→file driver switching for shared hosting
- **Symlink Repairs:** Automatic recreation of broken critical symlinks
- **Cache Optimization:** Laravel cache building and optimization
- **exec() Bypasses:** Manual alternatives for shared hosting restrictions

### **📊 Progressive Reporting**
- **Early Stage:** Prep report guides pre-deployment decisions
- **Post-Deployment:** Comprehensive analysis of deployment success
- **Health Monitoring:** Ongoing runtime health with auto-fixes

## 🛠️ **IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Scripts to Remove:**
```bash
❌ G3-SSH COMMAND preA: Version Compatibility Check-inDev
   # Reason: Conflicts with PhaseA-Pre1, redundant functionality

❌ PhaseA-Pre1: System Requirements Detection & Diagnosis  
   # Reason: Replaced by enhanced Phase-A-Prep
```

### **Scripts to Add:**
```bash
➕ Phase-A-Prep: Server Environment Validation & Setup
   # Location: Phase A (Before Upload)
   # Purpose: Server readiness validation + smart Composer logic

➕ Phase-B-Prep: Application Compatibility & Configuration
   # Location: Phase B (After Upload, Before Release)  
   # Purpose: Laravel app validation + smart DB testing
```

### **Scripts to Keep (No Changes):**
```bash
✅ Phase A: Pre-Deployment Commands (Before Upload)
✅ Phase B-First: Symlink Fallback Verification
✅ Phase B: Pre-Release Commands (After Upload, Before Release)
✅ Phase C-1: Post-Deployment Commands (After Release)
✅ Phase C-2: Comprehensive Deployment Verification & Reporting
✅ Phase C-3: Comprehensive Health Check & Auto-Fix
```

## 🔧 **DEPOYHQ VARIABLES USED**

All scripts use **DeployHQ's built-in variables** for portability:

```bash
%path%         = /home/.../domains/xxx/deploy
%shared_path%  = /home/.../domains/xxx/deploy/shared
%current_path% = /home/.../domains/xxx/deploy/current
%release_path% = /home/.../domains/xxx/deploy/releases/TIMESTAMP
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Portable:** Works on any domain/user account
- ✅ **Dynamic:** Adapts to any release timestamp
- ✅ **Consistent:** Matches existing script patterns
