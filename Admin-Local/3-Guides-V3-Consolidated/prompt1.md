1- help me understand what the step will do, is it corrrect, right, etc before doing it, in short.
2- do it
3- if any imporvements to fix erorrs, avoid future errors when we try the same steps on future apps , to complie in tracker detailed so once we done to update the guides. (i want the step report (ex: âœ… STEP 01 SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

i am not sure if someone tried to do the steps on thhis project or not but if yes maybe before initail setsp , need to assess the current state since we discovered this might be a pre-existing setup.



note: for next steps enhance details for Improvements Identified and Error Prevention Measures and be specific so who reads later understand

if a step we identify is wrong and must be fixed given its execution results- how about u see what the step has, and we try to imrpve it, dont destroy , we edit, we ad, we remove, not destroy all overwerite.- we upgrade, we ensure fix works, update step, update tracker.. then we proceed to next


## RULES
1- When u strart a new project, setup a tracker to capture current app info and 
- Current App info
- Setup status: first time, update, deployment, card info etc.

2- CodeCanyon Vendor Management Strategy:
Minimize vendor file modifications to avoid diff conflicts on updates
Use customization layer rules instead of direct vendor edits.
2-  if errors were found , ensure step are updated if had error found when executed step but then fixed, so next time step execuion doesnt cause errors.
3- when a script is used in a step md file, also add to step md below the script block, a bullet EXPLANATION, and subbullets and numbered subbullets,   explanation of whta the script do in summariezed yet easy to undersand way, steps maybe with example(s). aslo ensure to captuer that in tracker so we know what was done and track in case of issues.
