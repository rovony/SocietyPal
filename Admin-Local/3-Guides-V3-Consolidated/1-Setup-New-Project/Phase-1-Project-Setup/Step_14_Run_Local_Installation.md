2. **Access application via Herd URL:**
   ```bash
   # Visit your local development site
   echo "🌐 Visit: https://societypal.test"
   echo "🔍 Expected: CodeCanyon installer or application homepage"
   ```

## **Complete CodeCanyon Installation (if applicable)**

3. **Access CodeCanyon installer:**
   ```bash
   # If CodeCanyon app, visit installer URL
   echo "🛠️ Visit: https://societypal.test/install"
   echo "   OR"
   echo "🛠️ Visit: https://societypal.test/installer"
   ```

4. **Fill installation details:**
   ```bash
   # Database Configuration (for installer form):
   # Database Host: 127.0.0.1
   # Database Port: 3306

   echo "□ Database connection successful"
   echo "□ Tables created successfully"  
   echo "□ Admin user created"
   echo "□ Installation completed"
