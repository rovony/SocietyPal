---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: TEMPLATE CUSTOMIZATION REQUIRED**

### **üéØ THIS GUIDE USES EXAMPLE PROJECT DATA - CUSTOMIZE FOR YOUR PROJECT**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** All steps in this guide contain example data that MUST be customized for your specific project:
>
> - **Project Name:** Examples use "SocietyPal" ‚Üí Replace with YOUR project name
> - **CodeCanyon App:** Examples use "SocietyPro v1.0.42" ‚Üí Replace with YOUR app and version
> - **Domains:** Examples use "societypal.com" ‚Üí Replace with YOUR domain
> - **Paths:** Examples use specific user paths ‚Üí Replace with YOUR system paths
> - **Hosting:** Examples use "Hostinger" ‚Üí Replace with YOUR hosting provider
> - **Versions:** Examples use specific versions ‚Üí Confirm YOUR actual versions

### **üìã Before Starting ANY Step:**

1. **‚úÖ Read Step 01:** Configure all your project-specific variables first
2. **‚úÖ Confirm Current State:** Check what already exists in your project
3. **‚úÖ Verify Versions:** Use actual versions from your project files, not guide examples
4. **‚úÖ Ask When Unsure:** Request clarification for anything unclear or mismatched

### **ü§ñ When Using AI Assistant:**

Always provide your specific project details, not the example data from the guides. AI should customize ALL commands, paths, and configurations for YOUR project setup.

## **üìö GUIDE TERMINOLOGY & CONVENTIONS**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: "Vendor" Terminology Clarification**

**When we say "Vendor" in these guides, we mean:**

‚úÖ **CodeCanyon Author/Upstream Vendor:**
- The original author/company who created the CodeCanyon application
- The third-party software provider you purchased the script from
- Example: The developer team behind SocietyPro, TaskGo, etc.

‚úÖ **Vendor Files Include:**
- Application code: `app/`, `config/`, `resources/`, `public/`, `database/`, `routes/`
- Framework files: Laravel core application structure
- Author's custom modules, controllers, views, and business logic

‚ùå **"Vendor" does NOT refer to:**
- **`vendor/` directory:** Composer dependencies folder
- **Composer packages:** Third-party PHP libraries (installed via `composer install`)
- **Laravel framework itself:** The underlying Laravel installation

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents confusion between "vendor files" (CodeCanyon author's work) and "vendor/ folder" (Composer dependencies)
- Ensures clear understanding when preserving original author files vs managing dependencies
- Critical for proper Git branching and update management strategies

### **File Path Conventions**
- `PROJECT_ROOT` = Base Laravel application directory
- `ADMIN_LOCAL` = Administrative documentation directory
- All paths are relative to PROJECT_ROOT unless specified otherwise

### **Placeholder Conventions**
- `{YOUR_PROJECT}` = Replace with actual project name
- `{YOUR_VERSION}` = Replace with actual version number  
- `{YOUR_DOMAIN}` = Replace with actual domain name
- Text in `{}` requires customization per project

### **Environment Conventions**
- **Local:** Development environment on developer machine
- **Staging:** Pre-production testing environment
- **Production:** Live environment serving end users

### **üéØ Deployment Scenarios Supported**
The guide supports 4 different deployment approaches (all involve build processes):

1. **üîß Scenario A:** Local Build + Manual Upload - Build locally, upload manually to simple hosting environments
2. **ü§ñ Scenario B:** GitHub Actions - Automated CI/CD with GitHub workflows (builds on GitHub servers)
3. **üè¢ Scenario C:** DeployHQ Professional - Enterprise deployment platform (builds on DeployHQ servers)
4. **üì° Scenario D:** Local Build + Git Pull Deployment - Build locally, deploy via git pull on server

**Build Process Notes:**
- **All scenarios require a build process** for Laravel applications (Composer, NPM, optimization)
- **Local build scenarios (A & D):** Build on your development machine, then deploy
- **Remote build scenarios (B & C):** Build occurs on remote servers/services during deployment
- **Professional approach:** Ensures consistent builds regardless of deployment method

### **üå≥ Git Branching Strategy**

**Branch Structure** (6 branches total):
- üîµ **`main`** - Primary development branch, integration point for all features (current primary)
- üü¢ **`development`** - Feature development and testing branch (may become primary later)
- üü† **`staging`** - Pre-production testing environment branch
- üî¥ **`production`** - Live production deployment branch
- ‚ö™ **`vendor/original`** - Pristine CodeCanyon vendor files (protected, no custom changes)
- üü£ **`customized`** - Personal customizations and snapshots for CodeCanyon update safety

**Branch Purpose & Strategy:**
- **`vendor/original`**: Protected branch containing pristine CodeCanyon files, never modified
- **`main`**: Currently serves as primary development branch (may transition to `development` later)
- **`development`**: Feature development and testing (potential future primary branch)
- **`staging`**: Pre-production testing environment for deployment validation
- **`production`**: Live production deployment branch
- **`customized`**: Stores personal customizations and modifications as snapshots/backups for when CodeCanyon vendor pushes updates, ensuring custom work is preserved and easily accessible

**Workflow Pattern:**
```
vendor/original (protected) ‚Üê Pristine CodeCanyon files (never modified)
    ‚Üì
main/development ‚Üê Primary development work
    ‚Üì
staging ‚Üê Pre-production testing
    ‚Üì
production ‚Üê Live deployment
    
customized ‚Üê Personal modifications & snapshots (parallel branch for backup)
```

### **üìå Checkpoint Naming System**

## **üö® CRITICAL: HUMAN TASK CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL**

### **üè∑Ô∏è Tag Instruct-User üë§ Usage Rules**

**ONLY use "üè∑Ô∏è Tag Instruct-User üë§" for tasks that require human interaction OUTSIDE the codebase/terminal:**

‚úÖ **Valid Human Task Examples:**
- Going to Herd GUI interface and configuring settings
- Visiting GitHub.com to create repositories or manage settings
- Logging into hosting control panels (cPanel, Hostinger, etc.)
- Creating databases through hosting provider interfaces
- Configuring SSH keys in GitHub/hosting dashboards
- Manual file uploads through hosting file managers
- Accessing external services or third-party platforms

‚ùå **NOT Valid for Human Task Tags:**
- Terminal commands that AI can execute (`ls`, `cp`, `php artisan`, `git`, etc.)
- File operations within the codebase (reading, writing, editing files)
- Environment file creation or modification via commands
- Any task the AI can perform programmatically

### **üìã Mandatory Confirmation Process**

**For ANY step containing "üè∑Ô∏è Tag Instruct-User üë§" tags:**

1. **AI MUST confirm completion before proceeding to next step**
2. **Use `ask_followup_question` tool with this MANDATORY template:**

```
Step XX: [Step Title]
üö® HUMAN TASK REQUIRED üö®

Short Description: [Brief task summary]

Steps for human to follow:
1. [Specific numbered action]
2. [Specific numbered action]
3. [Specific numbered action]

Confirmation Question: [Specific question with multiple choice options when possible]
```

3. **Supplement with verification when possible:**
   - Use non-destructive commands to inspect results
   - Check codebase files that should have been affected
   - Verify system states that can be programmatically checked

4. **NEVER proceed without explicit human confirmation**

### **üìÅ Step File Structure for Human Tasks**

**When a step file contains human tasks, include at the TOP:**

```markdown
# üö® HUMAN INTERACTION REQUIRED

**‚ö†Ô∏è This step includes tasks that must be performed manually outside this codebase:**
- [Brief list of what human needs to do]
- **All other operations in this step are automated/AI-executable**

**üè∑Ô∏è Tag Instruct-User üë§** markers indicate the specific substeps requiring human action.

---
```

### **ü§ñ AI Assistant Enforcement**

**Any AI following these guides MUST:**
- Automatically recognize "üè∑Ô∏è Tag Instruct-User üë§" tags
- Stop progression at any step containing these tags
- Execute the mandatory confirmation process
- Document the human task completion in progress trackers
- Never assume human tasks are complete without explicit confirmation

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT AI GUIDELINES**

### **What AI Should Always Do:**

- ‚úÖ **Test Commands:** Verify commands work before suggesting
- ‚úÖ **Explain Reasoning:** Why this approach is recommended
- ‚úÖ **Consider Environment:** Account for different OS/hosting setups
- ‚úÖ **Security First:** Always prioritize security best practices
- ‚úÖ **Version Awareness:** Use current Laravel/PHP best practices
- ‚úÖ **Backup First:** Suggest backups before risky operations
- ‚úÖ **Verify Results:** Provide verification steps
- ‚úÖ **Document Changes:** Track improvements and reasoning
- ‚úÖ **Human Task Recognition:** Always identify and confirm human tasks using proper protocols
- ‚úÖ **Progress Verification:** Confirm step completion before proceeding

### **What AI Should Avoid:**

- ‚ùå **Destructive Commands:** Without proper warnings and backups
- ‚ùå **Hardcoded Values:** Always use variables and customization
- ‚ùå **Outdated Practices:** Check for current best practices
- ‚ùå **Incomplete Solutions:** Ensure full problem resolution
- ‚ùå **Security Shortcuts:** Never compromise security for convenience
- ‚ùå **Skipping Human Tasks:** Never proceed past human tasks without confirmation
- ‚ùå **Misusing Human Tags:** Don't tag automated/programmable tasks as human tasks
