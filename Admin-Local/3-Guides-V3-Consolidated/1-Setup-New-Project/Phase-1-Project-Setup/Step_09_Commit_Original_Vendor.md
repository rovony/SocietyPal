## **Original Vendor Preservation**

1. **Commit original CodeCanyon files before any changes:**

   ```bash
   # Commit original CodeCanyon files before any changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initial CodeCanyon files v1.0.4 (original vendor state)"

   # Create vendor/original branch to preserve original state
   git checkout -b vendor/original
   git push -u origin vendor/original

   # Return to main branch for development
   git checkout main
   ```

**Expected Result:**

- Original vendor files preserved in separate branch
- Ability to compare changes against original
- Clean rollback point if needed

**Why this matters:** When vendor releases updates, you can compare against original files to see what changed, making updates safer.
