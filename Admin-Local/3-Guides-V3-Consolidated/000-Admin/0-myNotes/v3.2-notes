# FIXES WE Needs
The workflow should be:
1- update the steps maybe names (Admin-Local/3-Guides-V3-Consolidated/1-Setup-New-Project/Phase-1-Project-Setup) and in general the Admin-Local/3-Guides-V3-Consolidated/00-General/Master_Checklist.md
Step 9: Commit Original Vendor Files - Preserve pristine CodeCanyon files first
Step 10: Create Admin-Local Directory Structure - Create organizational structure
Step 8: CodeCanyon Configuration & License Management - Use the structure to set up management systems



# later for frotnend update one click updates weh need to consdier similar to the below
(permission fixed, and i clicked instlation and now installtion is happening. now instllation is complete and we were given (Application has been successfully installed.

Superadmin login details
Email:	superadmin@example.com
Password:	123456) but some other codecanyon apps may have the superadmin info on docs - either wy add step in guide 14 to ask user to collect that info and you need to caputre it as a file in Admin-Local/1-CurrentProject added to gitiginroe or maybe added to .env.local as info before we change it later.

but also see the guide we created on permissions @/Admin-Local/3-Guides-V3-Consolidated/99-Understand/Laravel_File_Permissions_Security_Guide.md and see if any steps needed to be added before and or after the install we just finished - the current step.

lastly as i want to be able to track thinkgs i think we need a step where once we do finish install and have permission good to run an analysis to understand, and document what did the install do - changes in files and also changes in dataset- we will have one later similar for updates ..
)
Based on these requirements, we will need to:

1-Apply post-installation security lockdown (per the permissions guide)
2-Add post-installation analysis step to document changes
3-Complete related Step  with all these requirements
