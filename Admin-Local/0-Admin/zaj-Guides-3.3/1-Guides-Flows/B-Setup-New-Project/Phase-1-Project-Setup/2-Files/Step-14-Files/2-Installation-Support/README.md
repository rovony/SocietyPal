# 2-Installation-Support

**Purpose:** Support files and tools used DURING the CodeCanyon installation process.

## 📋 **What Goes Here**

This folder contains files that assist with the installation process itself:

-   **Environment templates** for installer configuration
-   **Database connection helpers** for installer troubleshooting
-   **Installer customization files** (if needed for specific CodeCanyon apps)
-   **Installation validation scripts** to run during the process
-   **Backup scripts** to create snapshots during installation

## 🔄 **Usage in Step 14 Workflow**

1. **1-Pre-Installation/** - Run before starting installer
2. **2-Installation-Support/** ← **YOU ARE HERE** - Use during installer process
3. **3-Post-Installation/** - Run after installer completes

## 📝 **When to Add Files Here**

Add files to this folder when you need:

-   **Custom installer configurations** for complex CodeCanyon apps
-   **Environment-specific settings** for installer
-   **Troubleshooting tools** for when installer fails mid-process
-   **Progress monitoring** during long installations
-   **Recovery scripts** if installation gets interrupted

## 💡 **Examples of Future Files**

2-Installation-Support/ 
├── installer-config.php.template 
├── database-test-connection.sh 
├── installation-progress-monitor.sh 
├── installer-error-recovery.sh 
└── custom-installer-patches/

## ⚠️ **Currently Empty**

This folder is currently empty because the basic Step 14 workflow doesn't require support files during installation. Most CodeCanyon apps use their built-in web installer without needing additional support.

**Files will be added here as we encounter CodeCanyon apps that need installation support.**
