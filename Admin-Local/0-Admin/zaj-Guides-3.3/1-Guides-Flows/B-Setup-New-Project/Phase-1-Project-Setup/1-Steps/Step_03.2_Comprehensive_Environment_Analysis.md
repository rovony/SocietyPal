## 📊 **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

After running the script, verify these results:

- [ ] **PHP Version:** 8.1+ detected and compatible
- [ ] **Composer Version:** 2.x detected and functional
- [ ] **Node.js Version:** 16+ detected (if using frontend assets)
- [ ] **Server Functions:** symlink, exec functions available
- [ ] **Laravel Compatibility:** Version compatibility confirmed
- [ ] **Build System:** Vite/Mix detected and functional
- [ ] **Hosting Compatibility:** Shared/VPS compatibility verified

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue: PHP Version Incompatible**
```bash
# Solution: Update PHP or adjust deployment target
php --version
# Update local PHP or configure server PHP version
```

**Issue: Missing PHP Extensions**
```bash
# Solution: Install required extensions
# Check missing extensions in script output
# Install via package manager or hosting control panel
```

**Issue: Node.js Version Mismatch**
```bash
# Solution: Update Node.js version
node --version
npm --version
# Update using nvm or direct installation
```

**Issue: Server Function Restrictions**
```bash
# Solution: Enable functions or use alternative deployment
# Contact hosting provider to enable symlink/exec functions
# Or switch to file-based deployment strategy
```
