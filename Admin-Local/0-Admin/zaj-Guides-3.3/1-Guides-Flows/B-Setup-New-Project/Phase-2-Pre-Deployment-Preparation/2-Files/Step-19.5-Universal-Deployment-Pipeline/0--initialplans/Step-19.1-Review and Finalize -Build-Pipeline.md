1. and same for build pipeline have each have subfolders like V1 , V2 -f or the full unversal 
# we need to add any steps , scripts to see if anything diff need to enhance build pipleline or is universal good.
Current universal version is Admin-Local/0-Admin/zaj-Guides/1-Guides-Flows/B-Setup-New-Project/Phase-2-Pre-Deployment-Preparation/2-Files/Step-19.1-Build-Pipeline/2-Universal-Build-Pipeline/V1-universal-Build-pipeline.md
---
steps will check if universal is good or project specific things need to add to the build pipeline, and cusom specific dev pacakges, etc..

so goal is not to enhance universal build pipeline, but rather to check, script, steps, substeps to see if build pipleine ins enough or should we add any additional step between current steps, or before or after and to give these exact steps with similar structure to the steps in the universal one, or if there is a chance to imporve the build pipelline for future projects maybe we can have that suggestion to create a new version of univesral pipleine- keep in mind universal pipleline will be used for all future projects (laravel with and without js not just the one we have now in currnet workspace.)
