## 1 - üñ•Ô∏è Deployer Commands: üîß Preparing Builder Runner VM

1. **Waiting for an available deployment slot**

        - Checking build allowance  
        - Checking access to repository  
        - Validating start and end revisions  
        - Checking connection to server (e.g., SocietyPal-Staging)  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Commands executed by DeployHQ (blackbox). 
        # We can only speculate what‚Äôs done here.
        ```

3. **Preparing repository for deployment**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Updating repository from `git@github.com:username/repo.git` for branch `branch`  
        - Fetching information for start commit `commitX-name`  
        - Fetching information for end commit `commitY-name`  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Commands executed by DeployHQ (blackbox).

        # Internal DeployHQ step.
        ```

2. **Generating deployment manifest**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Creating list of files changed/new in this build  
        - Calculating checksums and relative paths  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Manifest generation (system step).
        ```

3. **Storing artifacts**

        - Archiving build output for rollbacks or reference  
        - Making them available in DeployHQ UI/logs  
    - Commands:
