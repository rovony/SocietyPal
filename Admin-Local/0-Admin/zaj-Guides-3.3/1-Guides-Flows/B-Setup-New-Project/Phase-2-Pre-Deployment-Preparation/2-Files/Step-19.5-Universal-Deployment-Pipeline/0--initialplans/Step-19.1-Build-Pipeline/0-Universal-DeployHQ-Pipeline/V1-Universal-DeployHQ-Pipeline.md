# DeployHQ Pipeline ‚Äî Speculative SOP

> üí° **Note:**  
> We are speculating DeployHQ steps to:  
> 1. Understand how it works internally.  
> 2. Help in case in the future we decide to migrate away from DeployHQ.

## Current Pipeline Steps using Scripts & DeployHQ Auto-Injected Commands
v: v1

---

## 1 -  üñ•Ô∏è Deployer Commands: üîß Preparing Builder Runner VM

1. **Waiting for an available deployment slot**

2. **Performing pre-deployment checks**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Checking build allowance  
        - Checking access to repository  
        - Validating start and end revisions  
        - Checking connection to server (e.g., SocietyPal-Staging)  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Commands executed by DeployHQ (blackbox). 
        # We can only speculate what‚Äôs done here.
        ```

3. **Preparing repository for deployment**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Updating repository from `git@github.com:username/repo.git` given a specified branch `branch`. 
        - Fetching information for start commit `commitX-name`  
        - Fetching information for end commit `commitY-name`  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Commands executed by DeployHQ (blackbox). 
        # Likely git fetch + metadata collection.
        ```

## 2 - üñ•Ô∏è Deployer Commands: ‚öôÔ∏è Building on Runner VM 

1. **Checking out repository for deployment**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Creating working copy of repo at commit `commitY-name` (branch: `branch`)  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Blackbox step - likely "git checkout" of target commit.
        ```

2. **Setting up environment for build commands**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Preparing PHP, Node.js, Composer, Yarn/NPM environments  
        - Making PhantomJS or other dependencies available if enabled  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Environment preparation - system-managed (blackbox).
        ```

3. **Uploading repository to build server**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Syncing repo files to build VM  
        - Preparing files for caching/restore  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Likely rsync/transfer - handled internally by DeployHQ.
        ```

4. **Sending cached build to build server**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Restoring cached directories (e.g., `vendor/`, `node_modules/`)  
        - Avoiding redundant dependency downloads  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Cached artifact restoration (blackbox).
        ```

5. **Sending config files to build server**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Uploading project-specific configs (deploy.yml, env vars, secrets)  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Internal DeployHQ step.
        ```

## 3 - x Running Build Pipeline Commands (in order specified in Pipeline)- `User-Specified`
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Placeholder for your build steps (e.g., `composer install`, `npm run build`, `php artisan migrate`)  
    - Commands:  see build pipeline files - specified by user.

## 4 -  üñ•Ô∏è Deployer Commands: üîß Finishing Build Runner VM


1. **Running build pipeline üî®üõ†Ô∏è**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Placeholder for your build steps (e.g., `composer install`, `npm run build`, `php artisan migrate`)  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Build steps placeholder - to be defined by user.
        ```

2. **Receiving built files**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Collecting processed build output after pipeline completion  
        - Preparing files for packaging and transfer  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Tar/zip or equivalent creation - blackbox.
        ```

3. **Generating deployment manifest**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Creating list of files changed/new in this build  
        - Calculating checksums and relative paths  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Manifest generation (system step).
        ```

4. **Storing artifacts**  
    - Objectives (speculated):  
        - Archiving build output for rollbacks or reference  
        - Making them available in DeployHQ UI/logs  
    - Commands:  
        ```bash
        # Artifact storage (blackbox).
        ```
