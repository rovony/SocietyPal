# Strategy B: GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Automated deployment with GitHub Actions for team collaboration**

## Strategy Overview
- **Complexity**: üü° Medium
- **Automation**: üü¢ High
- **Best For**: Team collaboration, CI/CD workflows, automated testing
- **Time Investment**: üü¢ Low (automated after setup)

## Steps in this Strategy

### Step 22B: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup
- **Purpose**: Configure GitHub Actions for automated build and deployment
- **Activities**: Create workflow YAML, configure secrets, setup deployment pipeline
- **Output**: Automated CI/CD pipeline configuration

### Step 23B: Automated Build and Deployment
- **Purpose**: Execute automated deployment through GitHub Actions
- **Activities**: Trigger deployment, monitor build process, verify automation
- **Output**: Automated production deployment

### Step 24B: Post-Deployment Monitoring
- **Purpose**: Setup automated monitoring and notification systems
- **Activities**: Configure monitoring, setup alerts, establish feedback loops
- **Output**: Automated monitoring and alerting system

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository for your project
- Server with deployment automation support
- YAML configuration knowledge
- Comfortable with Git-based workflows

## Advantages
- ‚úÖ Fully automated on every push
- ‚úÖ Built-in testing and quality checks
- ‚úÖ Team collaboration features
- ‚úÖ Deployment history and rollback
- ‚úÖ Free for public repositories

## Considerations
- ‚ùå Learning curve for YAML and GitHub Actions
- ‚ùå Limited free minutes for private repositories
- ‚ùå Debugging can be complex (remote environment)
- ‚ùå Platform dependency on GitHub

## Next Steps
1. Configure **Step 22B** to setup your GitHub Actions workflow
2. Execute **Step 23B** to deploy through automated pipeline
3. Implement **Step 24B** for automated monitoring
4. Use **0-Common/Step_23_PostDeploy_Verification.md** for additional verification

## Cost Considerations
- **Free**: Public repositories with generous CI/CD minutes
- **Paid**: Private repositories have usage limits (~$0.008/minute after free tier)
