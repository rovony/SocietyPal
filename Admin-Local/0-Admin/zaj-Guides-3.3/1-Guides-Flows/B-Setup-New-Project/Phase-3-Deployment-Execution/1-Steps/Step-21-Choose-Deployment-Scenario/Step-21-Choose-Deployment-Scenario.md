- Teams wanting Git automation with manual build control

**✅ Advantages:**

- Familiar Git workflow (pull on server)
- Works well with Hostinger Git features
- Partial automation (code via Git, builds manually)
- Good balance of control and convenience
- No external CI/CD service dependency

**❌ Considerations:**

- Manual upload of build artifacts required
- Risk of version drift between code and builds
- Requires SFTP/FTP access for build uploads
- Some manual steps in deployment process
- Need to coordinate code pulls with build uploads

**🎯 Choose if:** You want Git automation with manual build control

## **Decision Framework**

### **Quick Decision Tree**

```
1. Do you have a team of 2+ developers?
   ├─ YES → Consider Scenario B (GitHub Actions) or C (DeployHQ)
   └─ NO → Consider Scenario A (Local Build) or D (Git Pull)

2. Do you need automatic deployment on every code push?
   ├─ YES → Scenario B (GitHub Actions) or C (DeployHQ)
   └─ NO → Scenario A or D is sufficient

3. Is this a professional/enterprise project?
   ├─ YES → Scenario C (DeployHQ) for best features
   └─ NO → Scenario A, B, or D depending on automation needs

4. Do you have budget for deployment tools?
   ├─ YES → Any scenario
   └─ NO → Scenario A, B (free for public repos), or D

5. Are you using Hostinger or cPanel with Git features?
   ├─ YES → Scenario D is well-suited for your hosting
   └─ NO → Choose based on other factors
```

# Check Phase 2 completion
REQUIRED_FILES=(
    "composer.lock"
    "app/Custom/"
    "scripts/link_persistent_dirs.sh"
    "Admin-Local/myDocs/TEAM_HANDOFF.md"
)

echo "📋 Checking prerequisites:"
for file in "${REQUIRED_FILES[@]}"; do
    if [ -e "$file" ]; then
        echo "  ✅ $file"
    else
        echo "  ❌ $file MISSING"
        echo "🚨 Please complete Phase 2 before proceeding"
        exit 1
    fi
done

echo "✅ All prerequisites met - ready for deployment!"
