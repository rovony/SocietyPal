## Finding 1: package.json changed.
# When Wrote:
While doing Phase 2 of new project 
i see package.json is showing yellow in source control meaning that the file change. While this might be ok after running install commands for phase 2, but i assume the goal is to try to minimze if possible changes

before u proceed i hope u did read @/Admin-Local/0-Admin/zaj-Guides/00-Admin/1-AI-Prompts/prompt1.md and take a look at tracker phase 1 we did before u - as i am not sure if you have been updating/filling the phase 2 tracker while u are doing them, the goal is to ensure things worked, if any issues to report them, and have things docuemnted. also as we aim to try to keep minimal codecanyon vendor changes tho sometimes with commands changes happen, so maybe add to trackker to commit locally all files pre starting phase 2, and once all steps done to check any files changes, not sure how or what but we need to ensure 1- tracker 2 documents, stuff and how we can capture that if any changes in the steps flow phase 2 or overall steps for new project so in case of new vendor codecanyon author updates we dont get conflicts or issues. Proceed but first before u do next step ensure to do the requested points above which are again as numbered list are
Prior to proceeding with the next development phase, execute the following mandatory preparatory tasks in sequence:

1. Review and analyze the documentation at @/Admin-Local/0-Admin/zaj-Guides/00-Admin/1-AI-Prompts/prompt1.md to ensure full understanding of established protocols and procedures

2. Examine the completed Phase 1 tracker documentation to understand previous implementation steps, identify any unresolved issues, and maintain continuity with established workflows

3. Verify that Phase 2 tracker has been consistently updated throughout current operations, documenting all completed tasks, encountered issues, resolution methods, and implementation outcomes for comprehensive project tracking

4. Create a complete local commit backup of all project files before initiating Phase 2 procedures to establish a rollback point and change tracking baseline

5. Implement a systematic change detection protocol to monitor and document all file modifications during Phase 2 execution, including specific files altered, nature of changes, and reasons for modifications

6. Establish a comprehensive documentation system that captures any deviations from standard Phase 2 workflows, procedural modifications, or additional steps required for successful implementation

7. Design a change impact assessment framework to evaluate how any necessary modifications during Phase 2 might affect future CodeCanyon vendor updates, ensuring minimal conflicts and maintaining upgrade compatibility

8. Create a standardized template for documenting Phase 2 implementation variations that can be referenced for future projects with different CodeCanyon vendors, preserving institutional knowledge and reducing setup complexity

9. Implement version control practices that clearly separate vendor-original files from customized implementations to facilitate clean vendor updates without losing custom functionality

10. Establish post-Phase 2 validation procedures to verify successful implementation while documenting the final state for future reference and troubleshooting

Only after completing all above documentation and preparation tasks, proceed with the next planned development step while maintaining continuous tracker updates and change documentation throughout the process.

## My Research:
# Package Version Management: Addressing CodeCanyon Project Setup Challenges

Based on your findings about package.json changes and the need for systematic documentation during Phase 2, here's a comprehensive analysis and action plan for managing package versions and minimizing vendor conflicts.

## Understanding the Package.json Changes Issue

When package.json shows as "changed" (yellow in source control), this typically occurs due to :[1][2]

- **Version range updates**: Commands like `npm install` or `npm update` can modify version ranges (^, ~) to specific versions
- **Dependency resolution**: New packages may require different versions of existing dependencies
- **Lock file regeneration**: Changes in package-lock.json can sometimes trigger package.json modifications

## Version Management Strategy for CodeCanyon Projects

### 1. Exact vs. Range Versions Analysis

**Using Exact Versions (Recommended for CodeCanyon Projects)**:
- **Advantages**:[3][4][1]
  - Prevents unexpected breaking changes from minor/patch updates
  - Ensures consistent builds across all environments
  - Avoids conflicts when vendor releases updates
  - Provides complete control over dependency versions

- **Implementation**: Remove `^` and `~` symbols from package.json
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.17.1",     // Exact version
    "lodash": "4.17.21",     // Instead of "^4.17.21"
    "axios": "0.21.1"        // Instead of "~0.21.1"
  }
}
```

**Range Versions Risks for Vendor Projects**:[5][4][1]
- Minor updates can introduce breaking changes despite semver compliance
- Many packages don't strictly follow semantic versioning
- CodeCanyon vendors may not test against all possible version combinations

### 2. Composer Version Management

For PHP projects, apply similar principles :[6][7]

```json
{
  "require": {
    "monolog/monolog": "1.25.0",           // Exact version
    "symfony/console": "4.4.20",           // Instead of "^4.4"
    "doctrine/orm": "2.8.5"                // Instead of "~2.8.0"
  }
}
```

## Mandatory Pre-Phase 2 Checklist Implementation

### 1. Documentation Review Protocol

**Action Required**: Since the prompt1.md file wasn't accessible, implement this alternative documentation review:
- Create a Phase 2 preparation checklist based on Phase 1 learnings
- Document all established protocols from previous phase completions
- Establish standard operating procedures for version management

### 2. Version Control Backup Strategy

**Pre-Phase 2 Git Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Create baseline commit before Phase 2
git add .
git commit -m "Pre-Phase 2 baseline: All files before vendor setup"
git tag "pre-phase2-baseline"

# 2. Create separate branch for Phase 2 work
git checkout -b "phase2-implementation"

# 3. Document original package versions
npm list --depth=0 > original-package-versions.txt
composer show > original-composer-versions.txt (if applicable)
```

### 3. Change Detection Protocol

**Systematic Monitoring Approach**:[8][9]

```bash
# Before each major step in Phase 2
git status > step-N-before.txt
git diff --name-only > step-N-changes.txt

# After each step
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 2 Step N: [Description] - Files changed: $(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | tr '\n' ', ')"
```

### 4. Package Version Locking Strategy

**NPM Configuration**:[10][11]
```bash
# Set npm to save exact versions by default
npm config set save-exact true

# Create .npmrc file in project root
echo "save-exact=true" > .npmrc
```

**Package.json Modification**:
- Remove all `^` and `~` symbols from dependencies
- Pin all versions to exact numbers
- Document reasoning for any version constraints

### 5. Vendor Update Conflict Prevention

**File Separation Strategy**:[9]

```bash
# Create vendor-original branch to track pristine vendor files
git checkout -b vendor-original
# Copy original vendor files here

# Create custom-modifications branch for your changes
git checkout -b custom-modifications
# Apply your customizations here

# Use merge strategy to handle vendor updates
git checkout main
git merge vendor-original    # Apply vendor updates
git merge custom-modifications --no-ff  # Apply custom changes
```

### 6. Phase 2 Tracker Documentation Template

**Required Documentation Points**:
- **Pre-step state**: File checksums, package versions, git status
- **Command executed**: Exact command with all flags and parameters  
- **Files modified**: Complete list with change summaries
- **Issues encountered**: Error messages, resolution steps
- **Post-step verification**: Functionality tests, version confirmations
- **Rollback procedures**: Steps to revert if needed

### 7. Dependency Impact Assessment Framework

**Change Evaluation Checklist**:
- Version differences between original and new requirements
- Breaking changes in updated packages
- Compatibility with existing custom code
- Impact on vendor update procedures
- Security implications of version changes

### 8. Lock File Management

**Critical Steps**:[12][8]
- **Always commit** both package.json and package-lock.json
- **Never delete** lock files during conflicts - resolve manually
- Use `npm ci` for clean installs instead of `npm install`
- Regenerate lock files only when absolutely necessary

### 9. Version Validation Protocol

**Post-Installation Verification**:
```bash
# Verify exact versions are installed
npm list --depth=0 | grep -v "extraneous"

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Validate application functionality
npm test  # or custom test suite
```

### 10. Future Vendor Update Strategy

**Preparation for CodeCanyon Updates**:
- Maintain separate branches for vendor-original vs. customized code
- Document all customizations with clear comments
- Create update procedures that preserve customizations
- Test vendor updates in isolated environment first

## Immediate Action Plan

**Execute in this exact sequence**:

1. **Stop current Phase 2 work** until documentation is complete
2. **Create comprehensive backup** using git tag system above  
3. **Convert all package versions to exact** (remove ^, ~ symbols)
4. **Implement .npmrc for exact version saving**
5. **Set up change monitoring system** with git tracking
6. **Create Phase 2 tracker template** with all required fields
7. **Document current state** as baseline for comparison
8. **Resume Phase 2 work** with continuous tracking enabled

This systematic approach will prevent conflicts with future CodeCanyon vendor updates while maintaining complete visibility into all changes during your development process.[13][8][9]
