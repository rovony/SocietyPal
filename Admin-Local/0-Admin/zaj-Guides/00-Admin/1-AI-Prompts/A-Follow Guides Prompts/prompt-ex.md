keep in mind - first we need to create new steps and or update steps and ensure the whole steps md files are in right order then we test full pipeline debug and finalize and then run and update tracker- seems u are starting by actually execution which should be last step- as we are trying to actually create an actual guide we can use for this project and future projects so next projects are easy.

TASK Steps
1- Task 1: Review prompt1.md documentation
2- Task 2: Examine Phase 1 tracker as a reference
3- Have a plan
4- Create and or update steps
3- Task 3: Verify Phase X tracker- we will update while we are doing phase at hand. we will then redo all steps and if need reupdate tracker given we may have new steps 
4- Task 4: Create baseline commit: ensure commit is just local - no 


So in phases
