last i requested was (we need to do PHASE 4: Post-Deployment & Maintenance
for Laravel - Final Guides/3-V3-Consolidated/1-Setup-New-Project
then Laravel - Final Guides/3-V3-Consolidated/2-Subsequent-Deployment
Laravel - Final Guides/3-V3-Consolidated/3-Maintenance
Laravel - Final Guides/3-V3-Consolidated/99-Understand

reminder (reminder (we agreed as i said in a previous chat , i paste here the previous chat u were doing(0-Setup-Computer-Server/
1-Setup-New-Project/ for all md steps for first time setup and first deployment
2- Subsequent-Deployment not sure how but basically codecanyon vendor release new updates we install as zip and we need to do
sometimes we may have cusotmization between vendor updaetes
0,1,2 are folders that have sequence of steps in the md files..

3- Maintanince, emergency etc - here maybe not sequence of numbed md but maybe each md is for something etc.also note as we are creating final draft maybe we can standraze numbers like update numbers so instead of 6.1 this becomes 7 and next ones moved, ensure orders are fully correct..and maybe 99-Understand/ this for the documents like intro, terminology , etc - not steps but to ensure we fully understand all
next i want you to start creating the md , but how can i ensure u use what we agreed upon so u dont hallucenate and start create out of ur ass- maybe before each 1-3 md file to be created u re-read Laravel - Final Guides/V1_vs_V2_Comparison_Report.md, Laravel - Final Guides/V3_Final_Structure_Plan.md- to ensure u write what we agreed and given our discussion on v1 and v2. if you agree start creating md and ensure to re-read the inputs files every 1-5 md files you create.)))))
ENSURE when u work to
follows the user's requirements as below:

-Consistent step numbering (12,13, 14, etc, sometimes for same scenario like 22A, 22B, 22C, etc.)
-All steps created only after reading source materials based on Laravel - Final Guides/V1_vs_V2_Comparison_Report.md
Laravel - Final Guides/V3_Final_Structure_Plan.md
