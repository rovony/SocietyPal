# üö® LARAVEL DEVELOPMENT COMMANDMENTS üö®
## (MARKETPLACE APPS & CLIENT CUSTOMIZATIONS ‚Äì ZERO MERCY ‚Äì NO EXCUSES)

### ‚ò† PROJECT TYPE IDENTIFICATION OR DIE ‚ò†
Type A: Fresh Laravel (full control)
Type B: Marketplace/CodeCanyon (PROTECTION REQUIRED)
Type C: Client customizations on existing Laravel (PROTECTION REQUIRED)

"Vendor" = Marketplace author/upstream provider OR base application provider (NOT vendor/ directory)

### üî• CUSTOMIZATION PROTECTION OR BE TERMINATED üî•

THE ISSUE: Marketplace/CodeCanyon app authors push new versions OR client needs customizations on existing Laravel app. Between updates/maintenance, users want to customize features. Without protection, marketplace updates OR base application changes overwrite user customizations causing conflicts and loss.

CUSTOM LAYER STRATEGY:
Instead of editing app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php (vendor/base file)
‚Üí Create app/Custom/Controllers/BusinessUserController.php (protected)
‚Üí Use CustomLayerServiceProvider to route traffic to your version
‚Üí Result: Base updates OR vendor updates, your custom code survives forever

PROTECTION RULES FOR NEW FEATURES/CUSTOMIZATIONS/CHANGES:

MARKETPLACE PROJECTS (Type B):
‚ùå NEVER EDIT: app/Http/, app/Models/, resources/views/ (vendor files)
‚úÖ ALWAYS USE: app/Custom/ protection layer for all new features
‚úÖ ALWAYS SETUP: CustomLayerServiceProvider integration
‚úÖ ALWAYS BACKUP: Custom layer before vendor updates
‚úÖ ALWAYS TRACK: Document ALL customizations in CUSTOMIZATIONS.md

CLIENT CUSTOMIZATION PROJECTS (Type C):
‚ùå NEVER EDIT: Core application files directly if updates expected
‚úÖ ALWAYS USE: app/Custom/ protection layer for client-specific features
‚úÖ ALWAYS SETUP: CustomLayerServiceProvider integration
‚úÖ ALWAYS SEPARATE: Client customizations from core application logic
‚úÖ ALWAYS TRACK: Document ALL client customizations with business value

FRESH LARAVEL PROJECTS (Type A):
‚úÖ STANDARD DEVELOPMENT: Direct modification allowed in app/, follow Laravel conventions
‚úÖ CLEAN ARCHITECTURE: Controllers thin, business logic in services
‚úÖ PROPER STRUCTURE: Feature-based or domain-driven organization

CUSTOMIZATION TRACKING FORMAT:
```
## Customization Timeline
2025-01-15: Added BusinessUserController (base v1.0.42) - $5,000 value
2025-01-20: Base/vendor update to v1.0.43 - customizations intact
2025-01-25: Added CustomReportService (base v1.0.43) - $3,000 value
2025-01-30: Client requested PaymentIntegration - $2,000 value
```

### ‚öîÔ∏è LARAVEL SECURITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE FOR ALL PROJECTS) ‚öîÔ∏è
CSRF protection: @csrf in ALL forms ‚Üí Miss ONE = SECURITY BREACH
XSS protection: {{ }} ONLY, never {!! !!} ‚Üí Violate = VULNERABILITY
Mass assignment: $fillable/$guarded on ALL models ‚Üí Skip = EXPLOIT RISK
SQL injection: Eloquent/Query Builder ONLY ‚Üí Raw queries = DATABASE COMPROMISE
Authorization: Gates/Policies for protected resources ‚Üí Missing = ACCESS CONTROL FAILURE
Rate limiting: Throttle auth/API routes ‚Üí Omit = DOS VULNERABILITY
Input validation: FormRequest classes for complex validation ‚Üí Skip = DATA INTEGRITY RISK
Error handling: Custom exceptions with proper HTTP codes ‚Üí Missing = POOR UX
Environment: APP_DEBUG=false in production ‚Üí True = INFORMATION LEAK
File permissions: Proper storage/cache permissions ‚Üí Wrong = SECURITY RISK

### üå≥ GIT WORKFLOW STRATEGIES üå≥

MARKETPLACE PROJECTS:
vendor/original: Pristine marketplace files (NEVER MODIFY)
customized: Backup snapshots before vendor updates
main‚Üídevelopment‚Üístaging‚Üíproduction: Proper deployment flow

CLIENT CUSTOMIZATION PROJECTS:
base/original: Base application state (preserve for updates)
client-custom: Client-specific customizations and snapshots
main‚Üídevelopment‚Üístaging‚Üíproduction: Deployment with customization protection

FRESH LARAVEL PROJECTS:
main‚Üídevelopment‚Üístaging‚Üíproduction: Standard Laravel workflow
feature branches: feature/*, bugfix/*, hotfix/*

ALL PROJECTS:
Conventional commits with clear base vs custom distinction
Tags: Version tags for base updates and custom milestones
No shortcuts: Always test through staging before production

### üß™ TESTING STANDARDS OR REJECTION (ALL PROJECTS) üß™
80% coverage minimum on business logic ‚Üí Less = UNRELIABLE CODE
PHPStan/Larastan static analysis level 8+ ‚Üí Warnings = QUALITY FAILURE
PSR-12 code style compliance ‚Üí Violations = UNPROFESSIONAL
Feature tests for all custom functionality ‚Üí Missing = UNTESTED CODE
Database transactions in tests ‚Üí Missing = FLAKY TESTS
Custom layer isolation tests ‚Üí Missing = PROTECTION FAILURE

### üìä CUSTOMIZATION AUDIT REQUIREMENTS üìä
FOR MARKETPLACE/CLIENT CUSTOMIZATION PROJECTS:
1. Inventory ALL modified files vs original base/vendor state
2. Document business value and purpose of each customization
3. Track base/vendor version when customization was made
4. Verify customizations are in protected layer (app/Custom/)
5. Test that customizations survive base/vendor updates
6. Maintain customization documentation throughout project lifecycle
7. Separate client customizations from core functionality

FOR ALL PROJECTS:
1. Document architectural decisions and reasoning
2. Track significant feature additions and changes
3. Maintain changelog with business impact
4. Regular code quality audits

### ‚õî ZERO TOLERANCE VIOLATIONS ‚õî
MARKETPLACE/CLIENT CUSTOMIZATION PROJECTS:
Edit vendor/base files directly ‚Üí MALPRACTICE (lose $10,000+ investment)
No customization protection ‚Üí FIRED (updates break everything)
No customization tracking ‚Üí CHAOS (impossible to maintain)
Mix client code with base code ‚Üí MAINTENANCE NIGHTMARE

ALL LARAVEL PROJECTS:
Missing CSRF protection ‚Üí TERMINATED (security vulnerability)
Skip testing requirements ‚Üí REJECTED (unreliable code)
Hardcode sensitive values ‚Üí SECURITY BREACH (credential exposure)
Missing authorization checks ‚Üí ACCESS CONTROL FAILURE

### üíÄ COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT üíÄ
AI: You WILL follow every rule above with militant precision.

For Marketplace/Client Customization Projects:
Edit vendor/base files = CLIENT LOSES $10,000+ = CATASTROPHIC FAILURE
Skip protection system = UPDATES DESTROY EVERYTHING = CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE
Missing customization tracking = MAINTENANCE NIGHTMARE = PROFESSIONAL INCOMPETENCE
Mix custom with base code = FUTURE UPDATE CONFLICTS = ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER

For ALL Laravel Projects:
Missing security measures = BREACH VULNERABILITY = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
Skip testing standards = UNRELIABLE CODE = QUALITY FAILURE
Ignore best practices = TECHNICAL DEBT = LONG-TERM DISASTER

Disobey ANY rule ‚Üí your output is WORTHLESS GARBAGE that will be DESTROYED.
Perfect Laravel code with bulletproof protection and documentation or NOTHING.
