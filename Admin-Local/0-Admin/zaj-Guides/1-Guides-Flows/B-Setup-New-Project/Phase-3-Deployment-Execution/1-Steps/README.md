## 🔄 Workflow Sequence

### **Step 21: Choose Deployment Scenario**
- Select the optimal deployment strategy for your project
- Consider team size, automation needs, and hosting environment
- Output: Clear strategy choice (A, B, C, or D)

### **Steps 22-24: Execute Chosen Strategy**
Navigate to your chosen strategy folder and complete the sequential steps:

#### **Strategy A: Local Build + SSH Deploy**
- **Step 22A**: Local Build Process
- **Step 23A**: Server Deployment  
- **Step 24A**: Post-Deployment Verification

#### **Strategy B: GitHub Actions CI/CD**
- **Step 22B**: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup
- **Step 23B**: Automated Build and Deployment
- **Step 24B**: Post-Deployment Monitoring

#### **Strategy C: DeployHQ Professional**
- **Step 22C**: DeployHQ Professional Setup
- **Step 23C**: Professional Build and Deployment
- **Step 24C**: Enterprise Monitoring and Management

#### **Strategy D: Git Pull + Manual Build**
- **Step 22D**: Git Pull Configuration (combined step)

### **Step 24.1: Post-Deployment Verification**
- Universal post-deployment tasks for all strategies
- Production verification and monitoring setup
- *Note: Will be renumbered to Step 25 in future versions*
