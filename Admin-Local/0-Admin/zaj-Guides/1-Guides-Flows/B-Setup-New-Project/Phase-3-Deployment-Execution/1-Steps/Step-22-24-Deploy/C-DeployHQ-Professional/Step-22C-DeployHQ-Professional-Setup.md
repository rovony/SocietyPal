# Step 22C: DeployHQ Professional Setup (Scenario C: Enterprise Deployment)

## Analysis Source
**Primary Source**: V2 Phase3 (lines 576-750) - DeployHQ build pipeline and professional configuration  
**Secondary Source**: V1 Complete Guide (lines 2050-2250) - Professional deployment features and zero-downtime setup  
**Recommendation**: Use V2's comprehensive build configuration enhanced with V1's enterprise deployment features and advanced optimization

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Set up professional-grade deployment pipeline using DeployHQ service for enterprise-level Laravel application deployment with advanced build optimization and zero-downtime deployment capabilities.

## ⚡ Quick Reference

**Time Required**: ~45 minutes (includes external service setup)  
**Prerequisites**: Step 21 completed, DeployHQ account, GitHub repository access  
**Critical Path**: DeployHQ account setup → Project configuration → Build pipeline → Deployment settings

echo ""
echo "5. Save project and note project ID"
echo ""
echo "⏳ Please complete project creation before continuing..."
read -p "Press Enter after creating DeployHQ project..."
```

### **1.3 Configure Repository Access**

```bash
# Create documentation for repository access setup
cat > Admin-Local/server_deployment/configs/deployhq_repository_setup.md << 'EOF'
# DeployHQ Repository Access Configuration

## GitHub Repository Integration

### Public Repository (Easier Setup)
- Repository URL: Use HTTPS format
- No additional authentication required
- DeployHQ automatically accesses public repos

### Private Repository (Secure Setup)
1. Get DeployHQ SSH public key from project settings
2. Add to GitHub repository: Settings → Deploy Keys
3. Grant read access to repository
4. Use SSH format: git@github.com:username/repository.git

## Branch Configuration

### Environment Mapping
- `main` branch → Staging deployment
- `staging` branch → Staging deployment (if separate)
- `production` branch → Production deployment

### Auto-Deploy Settings
- Enable automatic deployment on push
- Configure environment-specific builds
- Set deployment approval requirements (production)

## Webhook Integration
- DeployHQ automatically configures GitHub webhooks
- Verify webhook is active in GitHub repository settings
- Test webhook delivery after setup

## 🔄 **PHASE 2: Build Pipeline Configuration**

### **2.1 Create Build Commands Documentation**

```bash
# Create comprehensive build configuration
mkdir -p Admin-Local/server_deployment/configs

cat > Admin-Local/server_deployment/configs/deployhq_build_commands.md << 'EOF'
# DeployHQ Build Pipeline Configuration for SocietyPal

## Build Environment Requirements

### System Dependencies
- PHP 8.2 with required extensions
- Composer 2.x
- Node.js 18.x with npm
- Git for repository operations

### Build Optimization Settings
- Memory limit: 512M
- Max execution time: 300 seconds
- Build timeout: 20 minutes

## Build Commands Sequence

### 1. Environment Preparation
```bash
# Set PHP memory limit for build process
echo "memory_limit = 512M" >> /etc/php/8.2/cli/php.ini

# Verify environment
php --version
composer --version
node --version
npm --version
```

### 2. PHP Dependencies Installation
```bash
# Install production dependencies with optimization
composer install \
  --no-dev \
  --prefer-dist \
  --optimize-autoloader \
  --no-interaction \
  --no-progress \
  --audit

# Verify autoloader
composer dump-autoload --optimize --classmap-authoritative
```

### 3. Frontend Asset Building
```bash
# Check if frontend build is required
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  echo "📦 Building frontend assets..."
  
  # Install dependencies
  npm ci --only=production --no-audit --no-fund
  
  # Build production assets

  fi
  
  # Clean up node_modules to reduce deployment size
  rm -rf node_modules
  echo "🧹 Node modules cleaned"
else
  echo "ℹ️ No frontend build required"
fi
```

### 4. Laravel Application Optimization
```bash
# Create temporary environment for optimization
cp .env.example .env.build
echo "APP_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env.build
mv .env.build .env

# Cache Laravel configurations
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# Generate optimized class map
php artisan optimize

# Remove temporary environment file
rm .env

# Verify optimization
echo "📊 Optimization verification:"
ls -la bootstrap/cache/
```

### 5. Security and Cleanup
```bash
# Remove development files
rm -f .env.example
rm -f .env.testing
rm -rf tests/
rm -rf .github/workflows/test.yml

# Remove sensitive files
rm -f composer.lock.backup
rm -f package-lock.json.backup

# Set proper file permissions
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

# Verify final package
echo "📦 Final package contents:"
du -sh * | sort -hr | head -10
