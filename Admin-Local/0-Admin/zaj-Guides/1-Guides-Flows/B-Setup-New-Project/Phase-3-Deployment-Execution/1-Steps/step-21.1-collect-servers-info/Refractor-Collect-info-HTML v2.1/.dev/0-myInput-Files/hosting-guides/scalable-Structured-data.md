### NOTE:
the setup is meant to be scalable modular, so we can at any time add more. so maybe structure, standazie , in case we need to change things per hosting, add different ones. so yea ensure to have maybe template and convert hosting providers to structured data and that can feed to varaibles across app.


so template, individual hosting jsons, and in the app have variables that fill in based on these jsons.
