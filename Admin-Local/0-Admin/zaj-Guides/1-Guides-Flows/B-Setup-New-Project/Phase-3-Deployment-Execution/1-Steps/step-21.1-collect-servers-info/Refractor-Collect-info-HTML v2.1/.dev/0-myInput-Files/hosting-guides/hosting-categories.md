3. Configure build commands
4. Enable auto-deployment webhooks

**Manual Git Approach:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git /deployment/path

# Update deployment
cd /deployment/path
git pull origin main

# Set permissions
chown -R webuser:webgroup /deployment/path
```

### **FTP/SFTP Deployment**
**Traditional Upload:**
- File Manager (cPanel, hPanel)
- FTP clients (FileZilla, WinSCP)
- Command line SFTP

### **Container-Based Deployment**
**Docker on VPS:**
```bash
# Build and deploy container
docker build -t myapp .
docker run -d -p 80:8000 myapp
```

DB_USERNAME=prefix_user
DB_PASSWORD=user_password

# Limited environment variables
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
```

### **Managed Cloud Environment**
```bash
# Full environment support
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=app_database
DB_USERNAME=generated_user
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password

# Cloud services
REDIS_HOST=localhost
MEMCACHED_HOST=localhost
CDN_URL=https://cdn.example.com
```

### **Infrastructure Environment**
```bash
# Complete control
DB_HOST=rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=3306
REDIS_URL=redis://redis-cluster:6379
AWS_BUCKET=my-app-storage
SMTP_HOST=ses.amazonaws.com
```
