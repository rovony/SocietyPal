# Strategy A: Local Build + SSH Deployment

**Manual deployment with full control over the build and deployment process**

## Strategy Overview

-   **Complexity**: üü¢ Low
-   **Automation**: üî¥ Manual
-   **Best For**: Learning, full control, shared hosting
-   **Time Investment**: üü° Medium (15-30 min per deployment)

## Steps in this Strategy

### Step 22A: Local Build Process

-   **Purpose**: Build production assets locally on your development machine
-   **Activities**: Clean environment, install dependencies, build assets, create package
-   **Output**: Production-ready deployment package

### Step 23A: Server Deployment

-   **Purpose**: Upload and deploy the built package to production server
-   **Activities**: SSH upload, extract package, run migrations, verify deployment
-   **Output**: Live production application

### Step 24A: Post-Deployment Verification

-   **Purpose**: Verify deployment success and application functionality
-   **Activities**: Functional testing, performance checks, monitoring setup
-   **Output**: Deployment verification report

## Prerequisites

-   SSH access to production server
-   Local development environment setup
-   Comfort with command line operations

## Advantages

-   ‚úÖ Complete control over every step
-   ‚úÖ No external service dependencies
-   ‚úÖ Works with any hosting provider
-   ‚úÖ Easy to troubleshoot locally

## Considerations

-   ‚ùå Manual process (time-consuming)
-   ‚ùå Requires developer intervention for each deployment
-   ‚ùå Risk of human error in manual steps

## Next Steps

1. Complete **Step 22A** to build your application locally
2. Execute **Step 23A** to deploy to your server
3. Verify with **Step 24A** post-deployment checks
4. Use **0-Common/Step_23_PostDeploy_Verification.md** for general verification
