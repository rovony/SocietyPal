# Step 02: Create GitHub Repository

**Create private repository for project source control**

> 📋 **Analysis Source:** V2 Step 1 - V1 had nothing, taking V2 entirely
>
> 🎯 **Purpose:** Establish version control foundation for deployment workflows

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This guide uses SocietyPal as an example. For your project, use the repository name and details you configured in Step_01_Project_Information.md

---

## **GitHub Repository Setup**

1. **Create repository on GitHub:**

   - Name: `SocietyPal` **⚠️ CHANGE TO YOUR PROJECT NAME**
   - Private repository
   - **NO README file** (will be created during project setup)
   - **NO .gitignore** (we'll create custom CodeCanyon-specific one)
   - **NO license** (CodeCanyon projects have their own licensing)

2. **Important repository settings:**

   ```bash
   ✅ Repository name: SocietyPal  # ⚠️ USE YOUR PROJECT NAME FROM STEP_01
   ✅ Visibility: Private
   ❌ Initialize with README: Unchecked
   ❌ Add .gitignore: None selected
   ❌ Choose a license: None selected
   ```

3. **Note the SSH URL for cloning:**
   ```bash
   git@github.com:rovony/SocietyPal.git  # ⚠️ USE YOUR GITHUB_SSH FROM STEP_01
   ```

**Expected Result:** Empty GitHub repository created, ready for initial project commit.

## **🛠️ ERROR HANDLING & TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**

**❌ SSH Key Authentication Failed:**
```bash
# Fix: Add your SSH key to GitHub
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copy output and add to GitHub Settings → SSH Keys
```

**❌ Repository Name Already Exists:**
```bash
# Solution: Choose a different name or check if you already own the repository
# Update your PROJECT_NAME in Step_01 accordingly
```

**❌ Private Repository Not Available:**
```bash
# Check: Ensure you have GitHub Pro or organizational account
# Alternative: Use public repository (less secure for commercial projects)
```

### **Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Test SSH connection to GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com

# Verify repository URL format
echo $GITHUB_SSH  # Should match your actual repository
```
