# Requirement of the customization system
Looking at the current Step-17 guide, I can see it's quite comprehensive:

1. Easy to use - Simple commands, clear instructions, automated where possible
2. Super powerful - Works 100% of the time, handles any Laravel project with or without JS
3. Easy to navigate - Clear structure, easy to understand what's custom vs vendor
4. Frequent use ready - Since this will be done every CodeCanyon update, it needs to be
streamlined
