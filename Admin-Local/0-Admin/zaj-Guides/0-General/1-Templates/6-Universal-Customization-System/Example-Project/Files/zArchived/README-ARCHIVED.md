# zArchived - Outdated Example Files

## 📦 Purpose

This folder contains outdated or deprecated example files that are kept for reference but should not be used in new implementations.

## 📁 Contents

### `2-Example-Customization/` (Empty folder - removed)

-   **Status**: Deleted/Archived
-   **Reason**: Was an empty duplicate of `Example-Customization/`
-   **Replacement**: Use `Example-Customization/Enhanced-Dashboard-Widget.md` for traditional widget examples

## 🚨 Important Notes

-   **DO NOT USE** files from this folder in new projects
-   Files here are kept only for historical reference
-   All current examples are in the main `Files/` directory:
    -   `Files/1-Example-Setup/` - Core customization system
    -   `Files/2-Complete-Feature-Example/` - Complete analytics dashboard (NEW)
    -   `Files/Example-Customization/` - Traditional widget example

## 🔄 Migration Path

If you were using files from archived examples:

1. **Stop using archived files immediately**
2. **Study the new complete example**: `Files/2-Complete-Feature-Example/`
3. **Use current patterns**: All examples have been updated with latest best practices
4. **Follow current documentation**: All guides reference the active examples
