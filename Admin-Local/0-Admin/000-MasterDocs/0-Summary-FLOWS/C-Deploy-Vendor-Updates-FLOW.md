Of course. Here is the consolidated, single-flow process for deploying vendor updates.

This universal workflow is designed to be the single source of truth for all updates. It has a critical checkpoint step that determines whether the simple or comprehensive path is followed, ensuring both safety and efficiency. It also clarifies exactly how your tracking and protection systems are used at every stage.

### Flow C: Universal Vendor Update

**Objective**: To provide a single, robust, and repeatable process for updating a project's vendor code, intelligently handling scenarios both with and without customizations, while leveraging the full power of the "Zaj-Style" protection and tracking systems.

#### Phase 1: Pre-Update Preparation & Analysis

**Objective**: To safely prepare for the update, understand the scope of changes, and determine the exact path forward.

1.  **Step 29: Full Production Backup**
    * **Description**: Create a complete, verified, and restorable backup of both the live project's files and its database. This is the most critical safety net.
    * **Action**: Execute the production backup script. Store the backup in a secure, off-site location.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 29 as "In Progress". After verifying the backup's integrity, mark it "Complete" with the timestamp and backup file location in the notes.

2.  **Step 30: Download New Vendor Version**
    * **Description**: Obtain the new version of the software from CodeCanyon.
    * **Action**: Download and unzip the package into a temporary, external folder.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 30 as complete, noting the new version number (e.g., v3.4.1).

3.  **Step 31: Code Difference Analysis (Diff Check)**
    * **Description**: Generate a detailed report comparing the *old pristine vendor code* (from `/1-Source-Code/a-vendor-pristine/`) against the *new pristine vendor code* (from the temporary folder).
    * **Action**: Use a tool like `diff -rq old-pristine/ new-pristine/ > diff-report.txt` to list all file changes.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 31 as complete. Attach or link the `diff-report.txt` in the notes for an auditable record of vendor changes.

4.  **Step 32: Customization & Impact Checkpoint (Decision Point)**
    * **Description**: This is the critical decision step. Check for the existence and content of the `customization-manifest.json` file and review the Investment Tracker for any logged customizations.
    * **Action**:
        1.  Check if `/1-Source-Code/c-custom-code/customization-manifest.json` exists and is not empty.
        2.  Cross-reference the files listed in the manifest with the `diff-report.txt` from the previous step.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Customization Manifest**: This file is the primary source of truth for what has been customized.
        * **Investment Tracker**: Serves as a human-readable confirmation of the work that has been done.
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 32 as complete. In the notes, explicitly state the result: **"Result: Customizations DETECTED. Proceeding with Comprehensive Merge Path."** or **"Result: No customizations found. Proceeding with Simplified Update Path."**

    * **Description**: Based on the impact assessment, create a detailed technical plan for merging the code and a specific testing plan focused on high-risk areas.
    * **Action**: Write the plan, outlining which files need manual merging and which features need priority testing.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 33 as complete, attaching the merge/test plan.

6.  **Step 34: Create New Git Branch**
    * **Description**: Isolate all update work in a new feature branch (e.g., `feature/vendor-update-v3.4.1`).
    * **Action**: `git checkout -b feature/vendor-update-v3.4.1` from the `develop` branch.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 34 as complete, noting the new branch name.

7.  **Step 35: Update Pristine Vendor Baseline**
    * **Description**: Commit the new, untouched vendor code to your pristine directory. This updates the project's baseline reference.
    * **Action**: Replace the contents of `/1-Source-Code/a-vendor-pristine/` and commit the change with a message like "feat: Update pristine vendor code to v3.4.1".
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 35 as complete, noting the commit hash.

8.  **Step 36: Execute Comprehensive Code Merge**
    * **Description**: Carefully re-apply your customizations from `/1-Source-Code/c-custom-code/` onto the newly updated vendor files in `/1-Source-Code/b-vendor-modified/`, resolving any conflicts identified in the merge plan.
    * **Action**: Perform the manual code merge.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 36 as complete, with detailed notes on any conflicts resolved.
        * **Investment Tracker**: Begin a new entry for this update, logging the time spent on the merge process.

    * **Description**: On your local machine, run all automated tests and manually execute the full test plan.
    * **Action**: Run tests, perform QA, and fix any bugs that arise from the merge.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark Step 37 as complete. Note any bugs found and link to the commit that fixed them.

**(Follow this path if NO Customizations were found)**

5.  **Step 34: Create New Git Branch** (Same as above)
6.  **Step 35.A: Execute Simplified Code Replace**
    * **Description**: As there are no customizations to protect, directly replace the entire application code with the new vendor version.
    * **Action**: Overwrite the existing code, then commit the changes with a message like "feat: Update vendor code to v3.4.1".
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark this simplified step as complete, noting the commit hash.
7.  **Step 37.A: Basic Local Verification**
    * **Description**: Run essential local checks to ensure the new version isn't fundamentally broken.
    * **Action**: Run `composer install`, `npm install`, and any build processes. Launch the app locally and click through core features.
    * **System Usage**:
        * **Project Tracker**: Mark this simplified step as complete.
