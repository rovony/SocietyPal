Of course. Here is the revised "Flow A" for a new project setup, incorporating the detailed steps you provided and the critical principle of treating the tracker as a living document that is updated after every single step.

### Revised Flow A: Comprehensive New Project Setup

This workflow outlines the complete end-to-end process for initializing, developing, deploying, and maintaining a new project.

**Core Principle**: The Project Tracker is the central source of truth. It must be created at the very beginning of Phase 1 and meticulously updated immediately after each step is completed.
