# 🚀 V3 Deployment Guide - Quick Start

## ⚠️ **BEFORE YOU BEGIN - CUSTOMIZATION REQUIRED**

This deployment guide uses **SocietyPal** as a reference project. For your specific project, you **MUST** customize the following:

### 📋 **Step 1: Complete Project Information Collection**

**Go to:** `1-Setup-New-Project/Phase-1-Project-Setup/Step_01_Project_Information.md`

**Complete the AI Assistant Information Collection section by providing:**

- Your project name and details
- Your hosting configuration
- Your GitHub repository information
- Your local development paths
- Your database credentials

### 🔧 **Step 2: Universal Path Configuration**

**Reference:** `Universal_Project_Path_Template.md`

All subsequent steps will use the path variables you configure in Step 01. The template supports:

- **Any project structure** (simple, organized by technology, client-based)
- **Any hosting provider** (Hostinger, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
- **Any domain configuration** (production, staging, local)

### 🤖 **Step 3: AI Coding Assistant Setup**

When using AI coding assistants, provide them with:

- Your completed project information from Step 01
- The path variables you configured
- Any project-specific requirements

### 📁 **What Gets Customized Automatically**

Once you complete Step 01, these components adapt to your project:

- ✅ All file paths in deployment scripts
- ✅ Domain configurations across all steps
- ✅ Server directory structures
- ✅ GitHub repository references
- ✅ Database connection settings
- ✅ SSH and hosting configurations

### 🎯 **Example vs. Your Project**

| Component    | Example (SocietyPal)       | Your Project              |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Project Name | SocietyPal                 | **Your Project Name**     |
| Repository   | rovony/SocietyPal          | **yourname/YourRepo**     |
| Domain       | societypal.com             | **yourproject.com**       |
| Local Path   | .../SocietyPal-Project/... | **...YourProject.../...** |
| SSH Alias    | hostinger-factolo          | **your-provider-alias**   |

## 🏁 **Ready to Start?**

1. ✅ **Step 01**: Complete project information collection
2. ✅ **Review**: Universal_Project_Path_Template.md
3. ✅ **Proceed**: Continue with Step 02 using your customized configuration

## 💡 **AI Assistant Usage**

When working with AI coding assistants:

```bash
"Please help me with Laravel deployment using the V3 guide.
My project details are:
- Project Name: [YourProjectName]
- Domain: [yourproject.com]
