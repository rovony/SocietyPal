# Step 16: Test Build Process

**Test production build process to ensure deployment readiness**

> 📋 **Analysis Source:** V1's detailed scripts + V2's organization (our analysis: "Take V1's detailed scripts + V2's organization - V1 has better verification steps")
>
> 🎯 **Purpose:** Verify production build process works before deployment

## **Clean and Test Production Build**

1. **Clean previous builds:**

   ```bash
   # Clean previous builds to test from scratch
   rm -rf vendor node_modules public/build
   echo "🗑️ Cleaned previous builds"
   ```

2. **Test production PHP build:**

   ```bash
   echo "🔄 Testing production build process..."

   # Install production-only PHP dependencies (V1's approach)
   composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
   ```

**Expected Result:**

- `vendor/` recreated with only production packages
- Optimized autoloader generated for performance
- No development tools included (PHPUnit, debuggers, etc.)

**Flag Explanations:**

- `--no-dev`: Excludes development dependencies (testing tools, debuggers)
- `--prefer-dist`: Downloads stable releases, not development versions
- `--optimize-autoloader`: Creates optimized class map for faster loading

## **Test Frontend Build (if applicable)**

3. **Build frontend assets with V1's verification:**
   ```bash
   if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
       echo "📦 Building frontend assets..."

       # Clean install from lock file (production simulation)
       npm ci

       # Build production assets
       npm run build

       echo "✅ Production assets built successfully"

       # V1's enhanced verification
       if [ -d "public/build" ]; then
           echo "✅ Build directory created: public/build/"
           ls -la public/build/
       else
           echo "❌ Build failed - no public/build/ directory"
           exit 1
       fi
   else
       echo "ℹ️ No JavaScript build needed (PHP-only project)"
   fi
   ```

**Expected Result:**

- `public/build/` directory with compiled CSS/JS
- Manifest files for asset versioning
- Minified, production-ready assets

**Why `npm ci` then `npm run build`:**

- `npm ci` does clean install from `package-lock.json` (exactly what CI/deployment will do)
- `npm run build` creates production-optimized assets (minified, versioned)

## **Test Laravel Production Optimizations**

4. **Apply Laravel caching (V1's production simulation):**

   ```bash
   # Set local environment for testing
   cp .env.local .env

   # Test Laravel production optimizations
   php artisan config:cache
   php artisan route:cache
   php artisan view:cache
   ```

**Expected Result:**

- Config cached in `bootstrap/cache/config.php` for faster loading
- Routes cached in `bootstrap/cache/routes-v7.php` for faster routing
- Views pre-compiled in `storage/framework/views/` for faster rendering

## **Verify Production Build Works Locally (V1's Enhanced Testing)**

5. **Test the built version with V1's verification:**

   ```bash
   # Start test server
   php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8080 &
   SERVER_PID=$!
   sleep 3

   # Test that the built version responds (V1's approach)
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080 > /dev/null
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "✅ Production build works locally"
   else
       echo "❌ Production build failed local test"
   fi

   # Stop test server
   kill $SERVER_PID
   ```

6. **Restore development environment:**

   ```bash
   # Clear production caches
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear

   # Restore development dependencies (V1's approach)
   composer install
   npm install 2>/dev/null || true

   echo "✅ Development environment restored"
   ```

**Expected Result:** Production build tested and working, development environment restored, ready for deployment.
