## **Foundation Setup Steps**

### Step 1: [admin-local-setup] - Admin-Local Infrastructure Setup
**Location:** 🟢 Local Machine  
**Path:** `%path-localMachine%`  
**Purpose:** Create comprehensive deployment infrastructure in your Laravel project  
**When:** First step before any other deployment activities  
**Action:**
1. Create the Admin-Local directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p Admin-Local/Deployment/{Scripts,Configs,Logs,EnvFiles}
   ```

2. Verify directory creation:
   ```bash
   ls -la Admin-Local/Deployment/
   ```

3. Set proper permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 755 Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/
   chmod 600 Admin-Local/Deployment/Configs/
   ```

**Expected Result:**
```
Admin-Local/
└── Deployment/
    ├── Scripts/     # Deployment automation scripts
    ├── Configs/     # Configuration files (JSON, env)
    ├── Logs/        # Analysis and deployment logs
    └── EnvFiles/    # Environment-specific configurations
```

### Step 2: [deployment-variables] - Deployment Variables Configuration
**Location:** 🟢 Local Machine  
**Path:** `%path-localMachine%/Admin-Local/Deployment/Configs/`  
**Purpose:** Configure comprehensive deployment variables in JSON format  
**When:** After Admin-Local structure creation  
**Action:**
1. Create deployment variables configuration file:
   ```bash
   cat > Admin-Local/Deployment/Configs/deployment-variables.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "project": {
       "name": "Your-Laravel-Project",
       "type": "laravel",
       "has_frontend": true,
       "frontend_framework": "auto-detect",
       "uses_queues": false
     },
     "paths": {
       "local_machine": "/absolute/path/to/your/project",
       "server_deploy": "/path/on/server/deployment",
       "server_domain": "your-domain.com",
       "server_public": "/path/to/public",
       "builder_vm": "/tmp/build"
     },
     "repository": {
       "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git",
       "branch": "main",
       "commit_start": "HEAD~5",
       "commit_end": "HEAD"
     },
     "versions": {
       "php": "8.2",
       "composer": "2",
       "node": "18"
     },
     "deployment": {
       "strategy": "manual",
       "build_location": "local",
       "keep_releases": 5,
       "health_check_url": "/health"
     },
     "hosting": {
       "type": "shared|vps|dedicated",
       "has_root_access": false,
       "exec_enabled": true
     }
   }
   EOF
   ```

2. Customize the configuration for your specific project:
   - Update project name and paths
   - Configure repository URL and branch  
   - Set appropriate PHP/Node versions
   - Adjust hosting environment settings

3. Validate JSON syntax:
   ```bash
   cat Admin-Local/Deployment/Configs/deployment-variables.json | python -m json.tool
   ```

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Valid JSON configuration file created
📋 Project-specific deployment variables configured
🔧 Ready for script integration
```

### Step 3: [core-scripts-setup] - Core Deployment Scripts Setup
**Location:** 🟢 Local Machine  
**Path:** `%path-localMachine%/Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/`  
**Purpose:** Install essential deployment scripts for universal Laravel support  
**When:** After deployment variables configuration  
**Action:**
1. Download/create the core scripts (if not already provided):
   - `load-variables.sh` - Variable loading system
   - `comprehensive-env-check.sh` - Environment analysis
   - `universal-dependency-analyzer.sh` - Dependency analysis
   - `pre-deployment-validation.sh` - Pre-deployment validation

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. Test core script functionality:
   ```bash
   source Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/load-variables.sh
   echo "Variables loaded successfully: $PROJECT_NAME"
   ```

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Core deployment scripts installed and executable
🔧 Variable loading system functional

**When:** After environment analysis passes  
**Action:**
1. Run universal dependency analyzer:
   ```bash
   ./Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/universal-dependency-analyzer.sh
   ```

2. Review detected issues and patterns

3. Apply auto-fixes if offered, or manually resolve dependency issues:
   ```bash
   # Example fixes based on analysis results
   composer remove --dev fakerphp/faker
   composer require fakerphp/faker
   ```

4. Re-run analysis to verify all fixes

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ All dependencies correctly classified for production
📦 No dev packages used in production code paths
🔧 Production build will succeed without dependency issues
```

### Step 6: [git-validation] - Repository Validation and Cleanup
**Location:** 🟢 Local Machine  
**Path:** `%path-localMachine%`  
**Purpose:** Validate git repository status and prepare for deployment  
**When:** After dependency analysis completion  
**Action:**
1. Check git repository status:
   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

2. Ensure working directory is clean:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Pre-deployment preparation and Admin-Local setup"
   ```

3. Verify branch is ready for deployment:
   ```bash
   git branch -v
   git remote -v
   ```

4. Create deployment tag (optional):
   ```bash
   git tag -a "v$(date +%Y.%m.%d)" -m "Pre-deployment snapshot $(date)"
   ```

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Working directory clean and committed
📋 Repository ready for deployment process
🏷️ Deployment snapshot tagged for reference
```

### Step 7: [laravel-validation] - Laravel Application Validation
**Location:** 🟢 Local Machine  
**Path:** `%path-localMachine%`  
**Purpose:** Validate Laravel application configuration and readiness  
**When:** After git validation  
**Action:**
1. Test basic Laravel functionality:
   ```bash
   php artisan --version
   php artisan route:list
   ```

2. Validate critical Laravel components:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:show app.key
   php artisan config:show app.env
   ```

3. Test database connectivity (if configured):
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:status
   ```

4. Validate storage permissions:

📊 Database connectivity confirmed
📁 Storage permissions properly configured
```

### Step 8: [security-baseline] - Security Configuration Baseline
**Location:** 🟢 Local Machine  
**Path:** `%path-localMachine%`  
**Purpose:** Establish security baseline for production deployment  
**When:** After Laravel validation  
**Action:**
1. Review .env file for production readiness:
   ```bash
   # Ensure these settings for production:
   # APP_ENV=production
   # APP_DEBUG=false
   # APP_KEY=base64:... (set)
   ```

2. Validate .gitignore includes sensitive files:
   ```bash
   grep -E "\.env$|/vendor/|node_modules/" .gitignore
   ```

3. Check for hardcoded secrets in code:
   ```bash
   grep -r "password\|secret\|token" app/ --exclude-dir=vendor
   ```

4. Review file permissions:
   ```bash
   find . -type f -name "*.php" -perm /o=w
   ```

**Expected Result:**
```
🔒 Security baseline established
📋 No hardcoded secrets detected
✅ Production environment variables configured
🛡️ File permissions secure
```

### Step 9: [hosting-compatibility] - Hosting Environment Compatibility Check
**Location:** 🟢 Local Machine  
**Path:** `%path-localMachine%`  
**Purpose:** Validate compatibility with target hosting environment  
**When:** After security baseline establishment  
**Action:**
1. Review hosting-specific requirements based on your deployment-variables.json

2. For shared hosting environments:
   ```bash
   # Check for potential shared hosting limitations
   php -m | grep -E "exec|shell_exec|proc_open"
   ```

3. For VPS/dedicated hosting:
   ```bash
   # Verify deployment capabilities
   which composer
   which git
   which php
   ```

4. Test deployment compatibility:
   ```bash
   composer install --no-dev --dry-run
   ```

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Hosting environment compatibility confirmed
🔧 All required tools available for deployment
📋 No hosting-specific blockers identified
```

### Step 10: [integration-validation] - Complete Integration Validation
**Location:** 🟢 Local Machine  
**Path:** `%path-localMachine%`  
**Purpose:** Final validation that all components work together  
**When:** After hosting compatibility check  
**Action:**
1. Run complete validation suite:
   ```bash
   # Test all Admin-Local components together
   source Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/load-variables.sh
   ./Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/comprehensive-env-check.sh
   ./Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/universal-dependency-analyzer.sh
   ```

2. Verify all generated logs and reports are accessible:
   ```bash
   ls -la Admin-Local/Deployment/Logs/
   ```

3. Test script integration and variable loading:
   ```bash
   # Verify variables load correctly
   echo "Project: $PROJECT_NAME"
   echo "Local Path: $PATH_LOCAL_MACHINE"
   echo "Server Path: $PATH_SERVER"
   ```

**Expected Result:**
```
