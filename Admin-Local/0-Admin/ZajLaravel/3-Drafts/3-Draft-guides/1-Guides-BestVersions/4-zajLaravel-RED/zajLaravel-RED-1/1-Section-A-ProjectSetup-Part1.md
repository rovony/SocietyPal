   git checkout -b customized && git push -u origin customized
   ```
   b. These branches help track original code vs customizations
   c. Return to main branch: `git checkout main`

3. **Verify Branch Creation and Synchronization**
   a. List all branches: `git branch -a`
   b. Confirm all 6 branches exist locally and remotely
   c. Test branch switching: `git checkout development && git checkout main`
   d. Verify push/pull operations work for each branch

4. **Configure Branch-Specific Settings**
   a. Set up branch descriptions for team clarity
   b. Configure branch-specific merge strategies if needed
   c. Document branch purpose and usage in project documentation
   d. Set default branch protections via GitHub interface

### Expected Results ‚úÖ

## Step 06: Create Universal .gitignore
**üü¢ Location:** Local Machine | **‚è±Ô∏è Time:** 5-10 minutes | **üîß Type:** Version Control Configuration

### Purpose
Create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for Laravel applications with CodeCanyon compatibility, ensuring sensitive files and build artifacts are properly excluded from version control.

### When to Execute
**After branch strategy setup** - Ensures `.gitignore` rules are established before any commits that might include unwanted files.

### Action Steps

1. **Create Comprehensive .gitignore File**
   a. Create or update `.gitignore` in project root
   b. Include standard Laravel exclusions (vendor/, storage/logs/, etc.)
   c. Add CodeCanyon-specific exclusions for third-party applications
   d. Include build artifact exclusions (node_modules/, public/build/, etc.)

2. **Add Sensitive File Exclusions**
   a. Exclude environment files (`.env`, `.env.*`)
   b. Add authentication files (`auth.json`, private keys)
   c. Include IDE and system file exclusions
   d. Add deployment-specific exclusions

3. **Include Build and Development Exclusions**
   a. Exclude dependency directories (`node_modules/`, `vendor/`)
   b. Add compiled asset exclusions (`public/build/`, `public/mix-manifest.json`)
   c. Include temporary and cache file exclusions
   d. Add log and debugging file exclusions

4. **Commit .gitignore File**
   a. Add .gitignore to staging: `git add .gitignore`
   b. Commit with clear message: `git commit -m "Add comprehensive .gitignore for Laravel with CodeCanyon compatibility"`
   c. Push to origin: `git push origin main`
   d. Verify .gitignore is active with `git status`

### Expected Results ‚úÖ
- [ ] Universal `.gitignore` created with comprehensive exclusion patterns
- [ ] Sensitive files and directories properly excluded from version control
- [ ] Build artifacts excluded to prevent unnecessary repository bloat
- [ ] CodeCanyon-specific patterns included for third-party compatibility

### Verification Steps
- [ ] `.gitignore` file exists and contains all required patterns
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working directory with sensitive files excluded
- [ ] Build artifacts are properly ignored when created
- [ ] .gitignore committed and pushed to repository

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Issue:** Previously committed files still tracked
  - **Solution:** Remove from tracking: `git rm --cached filename` then commit
- **Issue:** .gitignore patterns not working
  - **Solution:** Ensure patterns match your directory structure and use proper syntax
- **Issue:** IDE files still being tracked
  - **Solution:** Add IDE-specific patterns or use global .gitignore

### Universal .gitignore Template

## Step 07: Setup Universal Dependency Analysis System
**üü¢ Location:** Local Machine | **‚è±Ô∏è Time:** 15-20 minutes | **üîß Type:** Dependency Management

### Purpose
Implement enhanced system to detect dev dependencies needed in production, ensuring proper package classification and preventing deployment issues.

### When to Execute
**Before any dependency installation** - This system must be in place before installing packages to ensure proper analysis and classification.

### Action Steps

1. **Create Universal Dependency Analyzer Script**
   a. Create `Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/universal-dependency-analyzer.sh`
   b. Include pattern-based detection for 12+ common dev packages
   c. Implement usage analysis in production code directories
   d. Add auto-fix functionality with user confirmation

2. **Create Analysis Tools Installation Script**
   a. Create `Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/install-analysis-tools.sh`
   b. Include PHPStan/Larastan for static analysis
   c. Add Composer Unused and Composer Require Checker
   d. Include Security Checker for vulnerability scanning

3. **Configure Package Detection Patterns**
   a. Set up detection for common dev packages that might be needed in production
   b. Configure usage pattern matching for Laravel-specific packages
   c. Include auto-discovery package analysis
   d. Set up Composer 2 compatibility validation

4. **Test Dependency Analysis System**
   a. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/*.sh`
   b. Test analyzer without composer.json: should handle gracefully
   c. Verify pattern matching logic works correctly
   d. Confirm auto-fix prompts function properly

### Expected Results ‚úÖ
- [ ] Universal dependency analysis system created and ready for use
- [ ] Pattern-based detection implemented for 12+ common dev packages
