- **Step 00: AI Assistant Instructions**
    1. **Purpose:** This step provides a comprehensive guide for using AI coding assistants with the V3 Laravel deployment guide. It includes instructions for AI-assisted development, error resolution, and continuous improvement.
    2. **When to Use:** Before starting any step, when encountering errors, or when seeking improvements.
    3. Action
        
        **AI Prompt Template:** 
        
        ```markdown
        I'm following the Universal Laravel Deployment Guide. I'm at Step [X] and need help with [specific issue]. My project is [Laravel version] with [frontend framework]. The error is: [paste error]. Please provide step-by-step solution following the beginner-friendly format.
        ```
        
    
    ## **Purpose**
    
    Establish a standard step for integrating an AI assistant into all phases of the Universal Laravel Deployment Guide. This includes explicit setup of an `ai-context-and-rules.md` file at project root, with actionable instructions for both initial setup and use at any guide step.

    ## **Action**
    
    ## **1. Create `ai-context-and-rules.md` at Project Root**
    
    **In your project’s root directory, create the file:**
    
    `bashtouch ai-context-and-rules.md`
    
    **Open `ai-context-and-rules.md` in your preferred editor and use the following template:**

    # AI Assistant Usage, Context, and Communication Guidelines
    
    **Purpose:**
    
    Provide a clear standardized reference for using an AI assistant throughout the deployment process, covering set-up, context, communication rules, and troubleshooting.
    
    ## **When to Use this Document**
    
    - At the beginning of your deployment process,
    - When returning to the project after a break,
    - Each time you need to request help from the AI assistant during any step.
    
    ## **Startup Template (to paste into every new AI assistant conversation):**
    
    `textI am following the Universal Laravel Deployment Guide.
    
    - I am at Step [X] ([Step Name]).
    - My project is [Laravel version], using [frontend framework or 'none'].
    - I need help with: [short description of challenge, question, or error].
    - Full context: [copy error output or logs here if relevant].
    
    Please answer in the step-by-step, beginner-friendly format used by the official guide.`
    
    Example — for mid-process support:
    
    `textI’m following the Universal Laravel Deployment Guide.  
    I’m at Step 15: Dependencies Installation.  
    My project is Laravel 10 with Vite.  
    The error is:`
    
    [Insert your error message or describe your roadblock here.]
    
    `textPlease provide a step-by-step solution in your official step format.`
    
    ## **Rules for Communicating with the AI Assistant**
    
    1. **Be Specific:** Always mention the current guide section and the precise step you are on.
    2. **Share Context:** Clearly state your Laravel version, any frontend tools, and the hosting/server type.
    3. **Copy Logs/Errors:** Paste exact error messages or symptoms; avoid paraphrasing technical errors.
    4. **Request Beginner Format:** Specify that you want a clear, beginner-friendly, step-by-step or checklist response.
    5. **Iterate:** If a step doesn’t resolve the issue, reply with the new error or state of the system, and request a next action.

    ## **Expected Result**
    
    - `ai-context-and-rules.md` appears at the project root
    - The file contains the clear template and communication rules above
    - All users and AI assistants refer to this file at project start and when troubleshooting
    - All AI conversations are structured, reproducible, and provide the needed context for the Universal Laravel Deployment workflow

    **Summary:**
    
    By performing Step 00, you ensure every user and AI conversation is consistently structured, making help and troubleshooting efficient, documented, and beginner-friendly right from the root of your project.
