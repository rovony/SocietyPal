Hello! I need your help creating a comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide based on the attached documents. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure the best possible result:

**Primary Goal:** Synthesize all the information from the attached documents into a single, coherent, and easy-to-follow guide. The final output should be a series of numbered markdown files, with each file representing a major part of the guide.

**Input Documents:**
*   [List of attached documents]

**Output Format:**
*   A series of numbered markdown files (e.g., `1-Introduction.md`, `2-Installation.md`, `3-Configuration.md`, etc.).
*   Each file should be well-structured, using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks to organize the content.
*   The content should be written in a clear, concise, and beginner-friendly tone.

**Key Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze and Synthesize:** Read all the attached documents carefully and identify the key themes, steps, and instructions. Synthesize this information into a logical and sequential guide.
2.  **Structure the Guide:** Divide the guide into logical parts and create a separate markdown file for each part. Use a clear and consistent naming convention for the files.
3.  **Ensure Clarity and Simplicity:** Rewrite the content in a way that is easy for a beginner to understand. Avoid jargon where possible, and if you must use it, provide a clear explanation.
4.  **Maintain Accuracy:** Ensure that all the information in the final guide is accurate and consistent with the source documents.
5.  **Use Numbered Steps:** All instructions and steps should be presented as numbered lists to make them easy to follow.
6.  **Incorporate Best Practices:** If you notice any best practices or important tips in the source documents, make sure to highlight them in the final guide.
7.  **Consolidate and Improve:** I have attached several drafts of the same guide. Please consolidate them into a single, final version that takes the best parts of each. Here is my analysis of the drafts:
    *   **Master-A-B-C.md**: This file is extremely detailed and actionable, with literal bash commands for almost every step. It's a great reference for the exact commands.
    *   **PRPX-A-D2-SECTION-A-B-C.md**: This file has the most consistent and clear documentation format. Every step has a clear `[step-id]`, `Purpose`, `Action`, and `Expected Result`. This is perfect for formal process documentation.
    *   **PRPX-B-SECTION-A-B-C.md**: This document has the best conceptual model, with a brilliant Visual Identification System (ðŸŸ¢ Local, ðŸŸ¡ Builder, ðŸ”´ Server, ðŸŸ£ Hooks) and a logical 10-phase structure for Section C.
8.  **Create a Master Checklist:** Before creating the detailed guides, please create a `0-Master-Checklist.md` file that contains a full and complete abbreviated checklist of all the steps.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing the final result!
