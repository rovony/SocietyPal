like action steps have nice numberd steps and subbulets, a,b,c..etc why the fuck u delete shit if its not wrong, u ehnace by adding to the current content to make the document better, not replace fuckkkk if its not a problem.

read and enhance- dont remove but enhance steps , scripts etc. its meant to be informative, steps , begginer friendly and include info and exact steps..so even if Enhancement Opportunities says to replace no, rather we want to imrpove. also if any steps are not clear, amke them cleeear using Prev-Mini-Draft has some of A section esp. 

YOu must fucking regive me sections 1-6 md files full, compelete and enhanced. dont say in the test enhanced just add at top v2.1.

dont fuckiing miss anything in original, goal is to apply enhancements, add missing steps and fucking ensure we have full and fucking final gudies md files. dont fucking test me.

FINAL we have great to use begginer frineldy steps, substeps, numbererd bullets, codeblocks, tags, emojis, each guide have initla chekclist at top, and all detials are in these 6 docs. if doc get begger , continiye in new like if 0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/2-FINAL-DETAILED-GUIDES/3-Section-B-PrepareBuildDeploy-Part1.md gets more than like lets say 1500 lines, then create 0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/2-FINAL-DETAILED-GUIDES/3-Section-B-PrepareBuildDeploy-Part1-2.md and continue there.
