## Step 6.1: Package & Transfer to Server
**🔴 Location:** Server | **⏱️ Time:** 15-25 minutes | **📦 Type:** Deployment Package

### Purpose
Create deployment package from built application and transfer to target server with atomic deployment structure, ensuring zero-downtime deployment capability and proper file organization.

### When to Execute
**After successful build and analysis** - This begins the actual server deployment process.

### Action Steps

1. **Create Deployment Package**
   a. Prepare deployment package structure:
   ```bash
   source Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/load-variables.sh
   
   # Create release directory structure
   RELEASE_ID=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   echo "📦 Creating release: $RELEASE_ID"
   
   # If building remotely, package for transfer
   if [ "$BUILD_LOCATION" != "local" ]; then
       cd "$PATH_BUILDER"
       tar --exclude='.git' --exclude='node_modules' -czf "../release-$RELEASE_ID.tar.gz" .
   fi
   ```
   b. Verify package integrity and completeness
   c. Document package contents and version information
   d. Create deployment manifest and checksums

2. **Transfer to Server**
   a. **Secure File Transfer**
      - Use SCP/SFTP for secure file transfer to server
      - Transfer to staging area before atomic deployment
      - Verify transfer integrity with checksum validation
      - Create deployment directory structure on server

   b. **Server Directory Preparation**
      ```bash
      # On server - prepare deployment structure
      ssh user@server "mkdir -p $PATH_SERVER/releases/$RELEASE_ID"
      ssh user@server "mkdir -p $PATH_SERVER/shared"
      
      # Transfer deployment package
      if [ "$BUILD_LOCATION" != "local" ]; then
          scp "release-$RELEASE_ID.tar.gz" user@server:"$PATH_SERVER/"
          ssh user@server "cd $PATH_SERVER && tar -xzf release-$RELEASE_ID.tar.gz -C releases/$RELEASE_ID/"
      else
          rsync -avz --exclude='.git' --exclude='node_modules' . user@server:"$PATH_SERVER/releases/$RELEASE_ID/"
      fi
      ```

3. **Shared Resources Setup**
   a. **Configure Shared Directories**
      - Link shared storage directories (storage/app/public, logs, etc.)
      - Setup shared configuration files (.env, keys, certificates)
      - Create symbolic links for persistent data
      - Verify shared resource accessibility

   b. **Shared Files Configuration**
      ```bash
      # On server - setup shared resources
      ssh user@server "
      cd $PATH_SERVER/releases/$RELEASE_ID
      
      # Remove directories that should be shared
      rm -rf storage/app/public storage/logs storage/framework/sessions
      rm -rf public/uploads public/user-content
      
      # Create symbolic links to shared directories
      ln -nfs $PATH_SERVER/shared/storage/app/public storage/app/public
      ln -nfs $PATH_SERVER/shared/storage/logs storage/logs
      ln -nfs $PATH_SERVER/shared/storage/framework/sessions storage/framework/sessions
      ln -nfs $PATH_SERVER/shared/public/uploads public/uploads
      ln -nfs $PATH_SERVER/shared/public/user-content public/user-content
      
      # Link shared files
      ln -nfs $PATH_SERVER/shared/.env .env
      ln -nfs $PATH_SERVER/shared/oauth-private.key oauth-private.key
      ln -nfs $PATH_SERVER/shared/oauth-public.key oauth-public.key
      "
      ```

4. **Pre-Deployment Verification**

   # Backup current symlink target
   if [ -L current ]; then
       CURRENT_TARGET=\$(readlink current)
       echo 'PREVIOUS_RELEASE='\$CURRENT_TARGET > rollback-info.txt
       echo 'DEPLOYMENT_TIME='$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) >> rollback-info.txt
   fi
   
   # Create data persistence backup
   bash $PATH_SERVER/shared/Admin-Local/Deployment/Scripts/backup-shared-data.sh

### Purpose
Verify rollback system functionality and capability to quickly restore previous version if critical issues arise with current deployment.

### When to Execute
**After successful deployment and health checks** - This ensures recovery capability is available if needed.

### Action Steps

1. **Rollback System Verification**
   a. Test rollback script execution:
   ```bash
   # On server - test rollback capability (dry run)
   ssh user@server "
   cd $PATH_SERVER
   
   # Check rollback prerequisites
   echo 'Testing rollback system readiness...'
   
   # Verify previous release exists
   if [ -f 'rollback-info.txt' ]; then
       PREV_RELEASE=\$(grep 'PREVIOUS_RELEASE=' rollback-info.txt | cut -d'=' -f2)
       if [ -d \"\$PREV_RELEASE\" ]; then
           echo '✅ Previous release available for rollback'
