Ensure the Final 3 Files have all needed 

THEN PHASE 2 Request: TASKS

Primary Goal: Synthesize all the information from the attached documents into a single, coherent, and easy-to-follow guide. The final output should be a series of numbered markdown files, with each file representing a major part of the guide.

Input Documents:
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/99-DevDrafts/combined/FINAL-Master-Scripts.md
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/99-DevDrafts/combined/FINAL-Master-Steps-detailed.md
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/99-DevDrafts/combined/FINAL-Master-Steps-table.md
And important Files to ensure quality created files
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/0-PreFace/1-Strategy.md
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/0-PreFace/2-10-Phases-Universal-Build&Deploy-Pipeline.md
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/0-PreFace/2-Standards.md
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/0-PreFace/Admin-Loca-Final.md

----


and Output Format:
*   A series of numbered markdown files
*   The content should be written in a clear, concise, and beginner-friendly tone.
Key Instructions:
1.  Given attached and some previous drafts use master but i think some steps maybe missing details esp app sources options new app, github repo as pull or marketplace codecanyon, also cusotmzation template layer to avoid chaning code to avoid changing code from codecanyon vendor not to have issues when vendor updates and rather keep customzations . Synthesize this information into a logical and sequential guide. you can use and compare sources and given strategy write the full steps, scripts, templates, etc.
 Structure the Guide: Divide the guide into logical parts and create a separate markdown file for each part. Use a clear and consistent naming convention for the files.
3.  Ensure Clarity and Simplicity: Rewrite the content in a way that is easy for a beginner to understand. Avoid jargon where possible, and if you must use it, provide a clear explanation.
4.  Maintain Accuracy: Ensure that all the information in the final guide is accurate and consistent with the source documents. paths, Admin-Local etc.
Use Numbered Steps: All instructions and steps should be presented as numbered lists to make them easy to follow.
6.  Incorporate Best Practices: If you notice any best practices or important tips in the source documents, make sure to highlight them in the final guide.
Create a Master Checklist: Before creating the detailed guides, please create a 0-Master-Checklist.md file that contains a full and complete abbreviated checklist of all the steps.lease let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing the final result!
use canvas to create md files
-0-Master-Checklist.md
- SECTION A - Project Setup-P1.md
etc
Then Create a series of md files to cover all phases all in numbered md files in 0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/3-FINAL-Guides
then and as supplementary, create the scripts detailed and writtien in guides (and templates, and any other files) (this doesnt mean not to write them in md files, but as a nother way to show the scripts, files, to get them ready syntax checked so when user have guides of them and if dont want to create them then can just copy these files. try to oragnize them based on the way Local-Admin will have them so all can be easily copy pasted.)

MOST impotantly as this will be a long process, to include todo with all steps, where initial steps to read source inputs,  and between add 1 step to re-read  sources to avoid u start making unrelated stuff so yes specificaly include steps in the todo to actually re-read and check.


and last step to stage all then Conduct full QC so i can see all staged and unstaged QC.


have any checklists in 
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/2-FINAL-CHECKLISTS

Have md guides in 
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/3-FINAL-Guides

have templates, scripts, files in
0000--A---Build-and-Deploy/3-FINAL-DOCS/3-Final-Scrips-and-Templates-and-Files


note: u can have more than 1 md per section like 1-Section-A-ProjectSetup-P1.md, 1-Section-A-ProjectSetup-P2.md, 1-Section-A-ProjectSetup-P3.md, etc.. same applies to all sections. the idea is to try keep each md manageable in lenght (<1000 lines roguhtly>)


same applies to all other sections. yet ensure the full set is 1 numbering seq like 1-, 2-, etc.
