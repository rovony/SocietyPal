Primary Goal: Synthesize all the information from the attached documents into a single, coherent, and easy-to-follow guide. The final output should be a series of numbered markdown files, with each file representing a major part of the guide..

and Output Format:
*   A series of numbered markdown files
*   The content should be written in a clear, concise, and beginner-friendly tone.


3.  Ensure Clarity and Simplicity: Rewrite the content in a way that is easy for a beginner to understand. Avoid jargon where possible, and if you must use it, provide a clear explanation.
4.  Maintain Accuracy: Ensure that all the information in the final guide is accurate and consistent with the source documents. paths, Admin-Local etc.
Use Numbered Steps: All instructions and steps should be presented as numbered lists to make them easy to follow.
6.  Incorporate Best Practices: If you notice any best practices or important tips in the source documents, make sure to highlight them in the final guide.
Create a Master Checklist: Before creating the detailed guides, please create a 0-Master-Checklist.md file that contains a full and complete abbreviated checklist of all the steps.lease let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing the final result!
 
 Then Create a series of md files to cover all phases all in numbered md files 
then and as supplementary, create the scripts detailed and writtien in guides (and templates, and any other files) (this doesnt mean not to write them in md files, but as a nother way to show the scripts, files, to get them ready syntax checked so when user have guides of them and if dont want to create them then can just copy these files. try to oragnize them based on the way Local-Admin will have them so all can be easily copy pasted.)
